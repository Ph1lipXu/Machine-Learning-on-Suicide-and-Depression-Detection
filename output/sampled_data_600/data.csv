1,"Can I get some support please...So I'm not as depressed as I used to be (I even posted on r/adviceanimals about it). My medications have been working and I had been feeling better, but then last night happened. Basically, and i dont want to go into details, my dad and I got into a huge fight about how I'm handling my disease (him thinking i should be working harder, me trying to explain that we need to celebrate the little victories). Since it is Saturday night and my parents keep telling me I am annoying my friends when i need to talk to them about my feelings, I was hoping i can just get some support from Reddit please, just like memes and stuff please. 
Thanks :)

I've been feeling so down, and I haven't got a soul to talk to. Not even my counsellor.

4,"Today I cut my hairMy hair has always been a thick mess of curls that went all the way down to my waist (even lower). And it became part of who I am. People associated it with me, they recognized me by it, by calling me 'rapunzel' or 'goldy locks' (even though I'm not blonde), since I was very little. It became a part of me. But it got to the point in which it became intoxicating. The best friend I lost a year ago, would call 'magic hair' or something in the lines of that. My bullies would call me 'samara' or 'witch'. The girls at school would touch my hair daily (still happens at college). My mom and my dad said that I should never cut my hair, because it was too 'beautiful', and that million of girls would wish upon to have it. And don't get me wrong, I loved it too. But it was holding me back to someone I no longer was. Reminded me too much of my best friend, those horrid days at school, what I never will achieve to be for my parents, and my brothers whom they have caused so much pain to my father. 

So today, even though it was hard, I cut it to the lenght of my shoulder. And people around me were so surprised, they thought that I had lost something, and that now 'they could no longer recognize me'. 

But I feel like I have been born again. And even though it was just a small act. It feels like a burden was taken off of my back.

5,"I don't know what to do and I have no hopes for the future.It's kinda tough to start from but ill try to sum it up as best as I can.  I've been depressed for a couple of years by now.  I'm a 16 year old male and have had a girlfriend for almost two years.  My emotions have been going crazy lately, constantly rising starting from around 5 months ago.  Now it was to the point where I constantly break down.  My girlfriend who I love so deeply tends to get unlike her in fights, she would say horrible things and take things out on me.  In the end of them she would say she was just mad.  Either if she did mean them or not, it gets absorbed straight to my heart.  Around five months ago we broke up and got back together after working things out after a couple of days.  She said she was willing to change that, change how she would handle things.  It has slowed down but it hasn't stopped.  She still did it sometimes and every time we fought I would end up bawling.  Even in the middle of it where she was too angry or upset herself.  I held faith she would change.  Until yesterday where we got into a fight while I was over her house.  It started with me venting how I've been even more depressed, but alongside that came with self doubt...so I wanted to clarify some things that I was paranoid with our relationship.  She claims I was creating problems and that it seemed like I wanted no more of this which was totally not true.  We keep talking for about 15-30 minutes until it was fixed, it was very minor.  We start kissing,  I don't wanna get into detail but after we stop she says, ""You got what you wanted."" Confused, I look at her and ask, ""What do you mean?"" Well then she continues to explain how she felt unappreciated and that it's all I ever care about.  Was it? Of course not.  I've been dating her for almost 2 years.  I collapse on the floor and break down right there.  She's just looking off somewhere.  I have no idea what to do or say...I hadn't had any idea of what I did wrong.  There was a huge juxtaposition of emotions and the fact that she had felt unappreciated LATELY sank straight into my chest.  This has happened before.  This isn't supposed to be a battle...we're supposed to support each other.  My Mom shows up then. I give her a list of all I have ever done to prove that I give it my all.  I leave.  I go straight to my best friend's house and bawl right as I couldn't take anymore.  I explain it all to him.  He gives his opinion and says, ""A relationship is when two people support each other...what she's saying proves it can't be healthy...there's an issue.""  I ask what he thinks of me.  He knows I pretty much get like this every time we fight and he said it's complete emotional abuse.  He says I know what I have to do.  And my gut said yes while my heart said no.  I go to school the next day and see her at the end to tell her...I used every last ounce of what I had left to do it and keep my composure.  I tell her why.  Tears...I can't get it out of my head...cause I never had stopped loving her...Just to see her, react to me doing this...I instantly go back on myself.  Been home staying alone for hours and hours.  My friends stay keep strong.  She texts me later at night.  My friend said I shouldn't, but I do what I want to do...just to talk to her even one last time.  The feelings I'm having were getting worse since I got home.  I start cutting.  Breaking down.  I still don't know what to do.  I finally beg for her back...but with whats already done, she doesn't know if we can go back.  I never mentioned planning to kill myself soon enough cause I don't want it to interfere but I'm left with nothing right now. My friends are asleep, so is she.  I'm thinking that I just wanna die after the person I've spent every second of the last two years with, it's ripped out of my life cause of me.  She said I lost faith...which I have in myself, and just left.  I still love her.  But I see no other solutions but ending it.  I've had nothing without her.  She probably won't come back...I practically grew up with her.  I've found no meaning or hope and I'm hopelessly typing into a computer for help.  I don't know what to do.  Even if she does take me back...I don't know if I should do it...It's like the false door illusion.  I feel either way will kill some part of me permanently.  I have truly hated myself for the last month and have wanted to kill myself everyday even before this had happened.  I love her so much but I feel like I ruined everything, and that she ruined it too, and no matter what it is, I feel it's my fault.

I can't kill myself because my student loans would fall on my family if my life insurance didn't pay out. Every day, I look at the news and see people worthy of being loved dying in horrible, tragic ways. It's awful to think that parents leave young children behind while people like me who don't want to live and whose lives are worth nothing remain. I wish I could die a hero saving someone who's actually worth it, but I'm too tiny and weak to do anything like that.

I used to have a lot of friends in high school and college, but only two of them ever return my calls or emails now. I guess the others just hung around me out of pity. I see people on this site making fun of people who are socially inept and I know I'm the kind of person they're talking about. I wish euthanasia were legal for people like me. Fuck, I can't stop crying.

I'm giving myself until August 4, 2017. At that point, I'll have credit well-enough established that I can refinance my loans without cosigners and then finally escape this living hell as a 27th birthday gift to myself.

12,"Now I know why he leftAll this time, I just thought that he left because of his gambling problem, or because of me. But. Now I don't know what to think about it. Short story, my dad left 10 years ago. Just straight up left. And I've always thought that he left for no particular reason at all. He just left. I was wrong. I've always thought that my mom didn't know where he was for 10 years. I was wrong about that too. I've always thought that she wouldn't lie to me about that. About him. I was so wrong. Now, I know what really happened. He had a gambling problem. They got a divorce and he left. Not only that. But he has been arrested multiple times, for grand larceny, and has generally been a shit human being. And I now know that my mom has been lying to me for 10 years. She once told me that she wanted to tell me that he had died, but she didn't. Just that he left. There were investigations into it. The grand larceny. I've seen emails about him. He was incarcerated multiple times. And now I don't know what to think. A rational human being would never want to see him. But I do. Just once at least. I want him to know what he did when he left. He broke my heart in two. I can count the amount of people who've done that on one hand. He's the reason I put up a shield. I try to protect myself from hurt. Not because I don't want to get hurt, but because I'm always hurting. Every minute of every day. With every second that I think about him, my heart continues to shatter. I don't normally like to let people in, and it's all because of him. I've thought a lot about what I would do if I ever saw him again. Even though I say it, I wouldn't want to hurt him like he hurt me. No, I would want to ask him, why? Why did you leave? Why did you let me live without you? Why did you hurt me so much? Why did you break me to the point where the only way I can keep living is if I hurt myself? Why did you make me so angry that I either hurt myself, or hurt those around me? I chose the first one. He needs to know what he did to me. He needs to know that whenever I talk about him, it's like splitting my heart in two, and allowing everyone to see. He needs to know that I cry about him. Way more often then he would cry about me, no one would cry about me. He needs to know that he makes me feel unloved. He makes me feel worthless. He makes me fall apart.

You are nobody. You are nothing. You will always be nothing. That's the first thing your body spits into your consciousness when it opens up its eyes in the morning. All you wanted was to wake up dead, but instead you woke up inside this; the American dream, or nightmare. Oh yeah.  Nightmares are dreams. You almost forgot, but now you remember. You turn over and stretch your body out on the bed like a skydiver. The comfortable sheets form the surface of a portal that can suck you down into the tranquil oblivion of your dreams. You lay there on the surface for ten, fifteen, maybe thirty or so minutes until your ego gets inflated to a point where you can no longer sink back to the bottom of that perfect, unfeeling, place. You wake up and stare off into space; your face blank, tired, and tearless. This is how you morn the loss of your ability to sleep. Fuck it, I'll lay here for as long as I can, your body tells you.

20,"VentingIt’s true. Depression follows you everywhere, forever. You may learn how to cope, how to deal, but never how to eliminate. You never learn how to eliminate that feeling of emptiness in your stomach. The feeling that even if everyone in the world was packed in a room, shoulder to shoulder, you would still be alone. Different. You feel like somethings wrong with you. Like no one else has any idea what’s going on in your head. You don’t allow yourself to think any different. The thoughts just keep coming of, “why am I like this, what caused this, and will it ever get easier?”. No. It will never get easier. Depression is not something that gets easier. It doesn’t necessarily get harder either, it just plateaus. You reach your peak of eternal sorrow and self loathing hoping that it’s the rock bottom. Hoping that this is as worse as it gets. Unfortunately this is not the worst, for even though you have hit your pinnacle of sadness, every time that feeling creeps back it feels like the first time again. Not only does this feel emotionally excruciating but physically as well. Your head pounds and your stomach turns, your eyes hurt at the sight of happiness. You convince yourself that the only truth in the world are the lies in your head. Not worthy or not normal. The opposite of a priority in the world who’s only meaning in life is to waste space. Days move slower but months move faster. Seasons change in the blink of an eye but the clock won’t tick. Your perception of reality becomes so altered that everything is either a threat, a fear, or a waste. No one can change your views and it doesn’t feel like anyone wants to. The emptiness that was once secluded to your stomach has now spread to the rest of your body. Often times you catch yourself zoning out and fantasizing about a better life with a better outcome, only to abruptly be dragged back to the realization that no amount of day dreaming is going to change what’s already done. Depression is not a mind state, it is not just a phase, and it is not something to brush off. Depression is an illness that manifests itself into a lifestyle that a lot of people get trapped in. Do whatever you can to not fall into this trap, and help however you can with people who already have. Like I said earlier, depression never goes away but you can learn how to cope and deal with it.

If you're wondering what that is, [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilator) is information about it. How did I get this way? What is life like? How do I deal with everyday life? Hopefully telling you will help you as much as me. Three years ago, on March 17, my friends were outside my house, one of them in possession of a pickup truck. Normally, I would not be at home at that time, due to track practice, but on Wednesdays our school let out an hour early. Having a chance to spend time with my friends, I saw them gathered outside, not knowing that the day before they played a sort of ""game"" in which a person hangs off the back of said pickup, and flies off as the driver brakes. I joined my friends, climbed onto the rear bumper at someone's request, but instead of hanging on I jumped into the bed. Without anything to grab onto I flew forward. My head smashed the truck right under the center-mounted high stoplight, which is [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_high-mounted_stop_light#Centre_High_Mount_Stop_Lamp_.28CHMSL.29). My neck broke at the C2 vertebrae, and I lost consciousness after realizing what had happened. After nine days in the hospital I flew to the Shepard Center n Atlanta, Georgia. I sent two months in rehabilitation, then came back to my hometown. The next ear I started my senior year of high school, learning how to deal with many things; my paralysis, my relationships with other people, my schoolwork, my well being, but I lacked attention to my depression.
I dealt with depression long before my accident, as a result of having an abusive father and going through he and my mother's divorce. In school and with friends I was always cheery, and it was easy for me to find people to socialize with and eventually befriend. However, after breaking my neck life tacked on many more difficulties. I had a pretty good handle on things, and by that I mean that I covered up my feelings well enough, until I got to college. Trying to deal with the demands of University, as well as my own issues as a quadriplegic, with depression, and on my own is the hardest thing I have done in my life. I guess this post has been a bit of catharsis for myself, but I would like to hear about some of you, your tribulations, and how you deal with things.
And for those wondering, I used  [this](http://www.etsy.com/listing/64832134/ipad-mouthstick-stylus) in conjunction with my iPad to type.

When she texts, my mind automatically goes to she's texting a guy she misses him. She's telling someone something I know that might break my heart. And that's one example.
I'm tired of doing this. She's miserable with it. I'm miserable with it. I don't like to think these things. Trust issues maybe. But I have no reason to think that of her.

29,"Not doing anything with my life at 20.Okay, so I dropped out of school when i was 16, since then it was an absolute mess and a spiral down. When I just dropped out it wasn't as bad but the problem is, I'm 20 now. I wake up at like 3 the afternoon, play games and watch youtube videos till 6am the next day then go to bed. I did my learners but for some reason I'm just too scared to drive, get a job, go shopping, I even get anxiety when people knock on my door. I still live with my mother and as i said I'm 20 years of age and nothing to show for it. I have an extremely loyal and amazing girlfriend and she always tries to help, but I feel like a disappointment to everyone. I still live with my mother, she supports me in every way and she says I shouldn't worry about a job now because I'm still very young. But my friends and my sister all have jobs, shit, my sister even has a child, she's married and she lives in her own apartment with a good paying job. I can't do anything and it feels like I don't care. I have 0 confidence and the more I try to do something, the less I want to do anything. I've had really suicidal thoughts and it's getting scary because some days it feels like I really want to go through with it. Could someone please give me advice? 

It feels like I'm really trying but I just can't get the commitment, inspiration or dedication. I am a lazy person but I was never this bad. I don't know what to do. I go through phases where I just break down in my room and I think it's because I'm so lonely. This is killing me slowly but surely.

I felt fine for the first month of being on them, but started to feel like I wasn't myself as time went on.. Right now, I just feel exactly like I did before I started on them, lethargic all the time, never go out unless I'm forced, struggle to do basic things like shower, get out of bed ect.

31,"How to feel pride/self-worth?Hey, guys!

I am not sure this is the right place to post this, since it doesn't DIRECTLY relate to depression, but you all have helped me quite a bit in the past, and I do get very depressed sometimes.

I graduated from high school last year and was accepted into college for Spring (January) admission versus the normal Fall semester. In the time I had free, I took classes at a nearby community college and stayed with my aunt. However, the change of settings REALLY hit me hard. 

At my high school, I did so much and had such a wonderful friend group. I was my horseback riding team's captain, I was the lead role in several stage performances, I traveled all across the world with my choir, I DJ'ed all of our school's dances, and I just overall felt so proud of myself. However, right after I graduated, I lost most of what made me feel so proud in high school. I have just concluded my semester at community college and it was pretty rough. I got so lonely and had nothing to feel proud of. I ended up seeing a therapist because I went through some horrible, horrible slumps of depression.

Since then, I have been with my family for Winter break and am going to my choice college soon. However, I still feel like I have nothing to be proud of anymore. What are some things I can do to re-establish my self worth? I recently built a computer and I felt really, really good about myself, but I can't just build a computer every time I get sad. What are some things I can do to make me feel of worth and proud of who I am?",depression,depression,0.75
32,"Self-affirmations are getting me nowhere...My therapist has been telling me that, whenever I feel the weight of depression or anxiety setting in, to catch myself and my thoughts before they can take hold. To divert them to something happier and more uplifting.

So, when I'm feeling hopeless, I've been telling myself, ""There are people who love you. Your friends appreciate your humor. They aren't just laughing out of pity. Hey, 20 people liked that one facebook status, remember? They'll love you and support you no matter what you decide to do in life.""

But it doesn't really help. I still feel the doubt... I still feel lost and alone.

It's really hard to see a future for myself in which I'm happy. Even in my best daydreams, it still falls apart and everyone leaves me. 

I just don't know what to do.",depression,depression,0.90
33,"What am i suppose to do ?For months and years i have been feeling completely useless in this society, I am not going to tell about all the shit things that happened in my life, because lets face it, it all ready happened, and now there's only going forward for me. I don't want to have mental problems but i do have them, i don't want to sit home all day but i do. I don't have friends. I have a summer job, every year the same thing. It barely keeps me out of my debts.
I am turning 22 this year, and since my 17th i have been doing the same thing. Work in the summer, trying to find a full-time job in the winter. But i keep returning to my summer job. My divorced parents keep trowing mental problems at me. Not encouraging me to do something with my life. But holding me back. When there is a problem with me, people tend to talk about behind my back, instead of letting me know what the actual problem is. 
My family and friends all do this. About everyone, is what me was told when i was about 11 years old, just when the bullying started at school. Developing paranoia at a young age. 
Not teaching me how i need to take care of myself, getting told i would make something out of my life when i was young. 
I felt always last in the family, like i didn't matter to them. Because i would make something out of my life, as they said.

Now the only thing people see in me is a useless little prick who has a heart of stone.
No I don't show my feelings, i keep my mask up. 
But this is getting harder. Not that i want to keep my mask up anymore. 
But I actually want to do something with my life. '
But i am not getting any options, I bet i will be stuck at home in the winter again doing nothing. 
Started smoking weed, because it helped me calm down, think less about all the bad things happened every day. But now smoking weed makes me think even more, without weed i think as much as i do smoke weed. 
Drugs isn't an option for me. People told me i would become a drug-addict like some of my family-members, I want to prove them wrong, even tho i am hopelessly addicted to weed. 

I don't like money. The only reason i work at the summer job is to pay bills. to stay out of debt.
Never really went on holidays, never had a lot of clothes, or food for that matter.
When friends would ask to come to the cinema to watch a movie, or go out in the weekends.
I was saying no. Because i knew they would've to pay for me. Knowing i wouldn't be able to pay them back. 
People always say money doesn't make people happy. But the reason i was bullied for years was because of the fact i didn't have much clothes. That i wasn't the cleanest looking person. Or smelling for that matter. Making fun of me for years and beating me up. 

Buying lottery scratchers. Hoping i would win a few thousand bucks, but i always and up winning nothing. But i keep going, just in the hope i get some money so i can get my own little house, get some movement in my life. Some change. But i don't think that will ever happen.

Currently at the summer job i am working 6/7 days a week. 5-12 hours a day. 
Every day i wake up thinking if i should go or not, because i don't really feel like doing anything all day. But i do go. Because my ""better half"" WANTS to go. But it's hard.
my co-workers can see my sadness in my eyes. They have seen it ever since i started working there when i was 17. 

But even knowing i am depressed, knowing my mental problems. I can't ""fix"" myself. 
People tell me to go and see a doctor. But then what ? hear the things I all ready know ? 
How can words help me ? I would come home and forget about it anyway. And not do anything with it.
 
People always have to explain things to me about 10 times before i understand it.
Not because i am stupid, but because my father always told me i don't understand a lot of things
Like i am some kind of moron who's good for nothing. 

I wish i had a job far away from home. Not to escape my life, family, or home. 
But to start over, staying in contact with my old family, but working on a new one. 
Somewhere were i could live, work full-time, make new friends. 

But honestly. I think i will stuck forever where i am now. 
There won't be improvements for me in life. 
I want to improve. But I don't think i will ever be able to do that without a way out. 

For a few months now i have been thinking to just end my life.
But i won't, i could, but i won't. 
I don't want the easy way out. 

Talking with people doesn't make a difference for me. 
Crying about it doesn't make a difference for me. 
Hurting myself doesn't make a difference for me. 
I don't feel any better by doing anything good. 
The only thing i am good at is sitting on my chair watching movies and series. 
Trying to find those little details that are wrong in them. 
If there is one thing i truly would love it would be working on movie/serie sets. 

But going to school for it ? I am afraid the same shit would happen as the years i have all ready been trough at school. I would be sitting in a class with people 5 years younger than me. Because i am too stupid for university. 

But then i see a lot of people getting money from our government, saying they can't work. But in reality they are just lazy good for nothing people who choose to stay home all day. 

I rather go hundreds/thousands of euro's in debt then getting money from the government. 
Because i want to do something useful in my life god damn it. 

I am so tired of myself. And the people around here. Get me out of here. 

So my question to you guys is. 

What should i do ? Because i have been clueless for years.

So I have no idea where to start. I have borderline personality disorder, and my head is so noisy right now I can`t focus on school. I took xanax for a year and a half, and then I quit taking it and could focus on school. My head was okay, not many nervous thoughts, I did my homework right and everything went okay. 
After a while I met a guy, and the ""relationship"" was a fail. he used me to make some other girl jealous and of course my bpd came along with me and I messed it up. I became suffocating and I even lied to him about period being late. He told me to fk off big time. 
I am ignoring him at the moment but after the break up, I am sent back in hell. I started drinking to silence my mind from the scenarios I made up. But of course, I can not drink, cause my finals are here and I need to prepare for them. I failed two tests and I feel like Im going downhill big time. 

I just can not stop my mind from being anxious and sad and making up scenarios in my head. If I went to a theraphist they would probably say Im schitzophrenic which I am not. I know it is me inside my head, I know it is bpd and I know I can silence it with xanax and alcohol. But I am constantly at school and I can not go to doctor for a xanax prescription, also I can not study because I can not focus.

I constantly check my phone, waiting for him to call me. I know that he is not worth it, I know it so damn well, but my bpd is so damn deep that I feel like texting him all the time. Not sure what I would text though. I feel like yelling at him and meeting him at the same time.

I can't believe I got put on pills at 14, although I probably did need it given that I was self harming and I made a pathetic attempt at trying to off myself by taking a bunch of Advil, but I puked them up, and then realized it was a stupid idea. After various medications, Lexapro helped the most, and the weight gain wasn't that noticeable since I was fairly active. Once I got more friends, I thought I was over it, but I experimented with drugs in high school. It made my mood all over the place, but I still succeeded in high school. I'm in college now, and I have mediocre grades and my school is full of racist, homophobic, white privilege students (which includes my 3 roommates). I've managed to complete three years of an undergraduate degree, but I have no motivation now. My parents have been over-controlling since Day 1, and it's mainly my Mom who I get my anxiety and depression from. If it wasn't for my Dad she would not be able to function. He cooks, cleans, and gives her rides to work. I know she loves me, but she'll say hurtful comments sometimes that I think is just a projection of her own frustration with her job. 

I've only been able to handle three classes at a time these past two years due to my depression and anxiety. I was forced to drop two of my classes because otherwise I would fail. I didn't turn in assignments, and now I'm just taking two classes, and I'm worried I might not even pass one of them.

I even self-harmed yesterday, which I haven't done in years. I know it's stupid, but it felt good to be detached from it.

I cannot afford to go back and I would have to do all 4 years again which I just don't have the time for I want to live a life not be in education forever. While at uni I was applying for jobs and never got a job interview and as such I have no money (my parents are keeping me) and no experience. 

In addition to that I have no friends. Never have had. Nobody wants to talk to me and nobody will give me a chance. 4 years at uni and whenever I would talk to somebody they'd be dismissive or ignore me. At school people tolerated me to hang about with but I wa never there friend. I have tried looking for friends online etc but again no luck. I haven't done anything in life, don't get to go out and do normal stuff and experience just everyday stuff and nothing is enjoyable anymore.

but i digress. the hardest part is i dont know why so i cant even begin to guess at how to fix it. i dont think im bad enough for medication. i cant see me being a danger to myself or others. sometimes i think its all in my head and im just using ""depression"" as an excuse for my laziness and my lack of motivation towards everything in life. sometimes i think its quite pathetic and im just running away like ive done for the past 10 years cause i simply can't be bothered to try at life. something like expectations will only lead to disappointment and all that jazz. its almost like im not damaged enough for it to really count, like im making it all up.

I got hit pretty good last year and in may (end of the season) i started feeling different. I was depressed and had bad thoughts all the time. It lasted for a month or so but i didnt want to get help. Finally it went away. Now its may again and i have been hit or fallen on my head a few times and my depression is back. Its not as bad as before (hopefully it doesnt get as bad) but randomly this past year ive been getting very scary violent thoughts that i would NEVER act out on. They are coming back now even more with depression. At first i thought it was hormone imbalance because i had a few other symptoms that made me believe so. I also thought it was ocd because i always have to have things PERFECT like if there is a pice of lint on my shirt it will not stop bothering me until i remove it (not the best example i know). But now i think its linked to the hits of lacrosse.

55,"Can you learn to tolerate depression and even learn others to handle it?Hello Reddit, I'm very new here. :) I found this subreddit very fast, like a magnet drawn to the subject.

This is already starting to sound like a lecture in the subject and that's not it at all. I have no background or expert knowledge in this area at all. It's just that there's interest. For myself and for you. Sounds cheesy but it's true.

To the subject... finally. Why wouldn't we be able to accept depression as part of a normal and functioning life? Because alot of people are really scared of depression, negativity and especially death. Death is a subject many people try to avoid when it is actually a normal part of life. 

Do you feel that you can't reflect your life in a negative way because others would feel it weird and strange? I'd say continue to reflect and explore obscure negativity. If you do and feel it's completely fine to do so, you might actually learn to tolerate and learn to be balanced. Ahh, how much potential people must have but feel they ought to be quiet about how they reason life questions and thus also limiting themselves. 

Depression is so common in the world that it should be discussed alot more, I know this may not say much to you as an individual with your eventual urgent problems. I don't even know why I sit here typing this in 2 in the morning. Maybe this text won't mean squat. 

What I'm trying to say is that people should embrace and learn from negativity but don't get swallowed by its complete darkness (which of course is easier said or written than done). Allow yourself to go deep thinking. If you're open to it you might inspire others to accept negativity as part of a normal life.

I don't even know if this text is appropriate anymore, I feel I lost track. Is there even something to discuss? Ah, I'll post it anyway.",depression,depression,0.95
56,"Is cognitive impairment from depression a real thing?I want to do my masters to have a shot at getting out of this horrible workplace. But I'm afraid I don't have the IQ to study at that level anymore. I have a masters degree in a useless subject from 5 years ago btw. But I can feel that my brain isn't the same anymore. 

I'm always at a loss what to say or do. I'm perpetually overwhelmed. As a result, I've become a nervous wreck. 

Theoretically I could work harder than anyone to pull through. But after going to the hospital for sleep deprivation a few years ago, I have an enormous fear of not getting enough sleep every night. My current medication makes me sleep for 10 hours. Given the amount of sleep I need to stay sane, I don't think I can dedicate as much time as I think I should to study.

58,"Lately I've just not been myself... and i've forgot entirely who I was before... (help)Dear anyone out there, 
I'm an 18 yr old male college student and I was diagnosed with depression when i was a junior in high school. At the time i denied it completely because i didn't feel depressed in my everyday life, it was just my parents and being alone at home as an only child that were the only things that brought me down.

Lately however, I'm back from college for the summer and I'm just going through a really tough time and I don't know what to do. 

My biggest problem I can identify is probably my *severe social anxiety*. I constantly avoid talking to people because I never know what to say. I use to be really funny in middle school, carrying on into high school and now I feel boring, unfunny, and unsociable. 

I've always been really athletic and I'm in really good shape (6'3'', nice abs) but i struggle with girls.  I've never been the best at talking to girls and lately i've found that I'm too scared of sounding stupid or making things awkward (i fear awkward silence so much) so that sometimes I avoid talking at all most of the time (I come off as shy and quiet to many).

I do this partly due to my guilt I feel as a member of the male gender. So many guys I see are such douches to girls and are such assholes in general so I've always tried to not be that kind of person. What ends up happening however is that my more upfront friends (a couple are dicks when it comes to girls) end up getting the girl at a party or at the club or something and I'm just stuck with another night alone without a girl. 

My friends ask me how I'm not getting more chicks. I guess I'm not really the hookup type and I'd rather have something I can rely on but thats hard after a breakup of an 18th month relationship that ended almost a year ago that still haunts me a bit. 

I've never got a girls number I thought was cute or really ever made moves on a girl, I kinda just let them come to me, which usually results in girls that I'm not that into,... I'm always really scared of a girl finding out i like her (i had a girlfriend in middle school whom I asked out and was so scared to talk to in person again that I basically avoided her for a month until she broke up with me (first relationship actually))

Coming back from college and not seeing much of my hometown friends for a year, I feel so far apart from them and growing further apart each day. The things we use to do don't seem to fun anymore. I'm usually happy with them but I feel awkward even with them sometimes.

I have to force myself to smile sometimes and I don't find pleasure in much of anything anymore. I just feel so helpless and insecure. I feel like such a ""little girl"" (no offense) with what I feel too. 

*I'm also never sure of myself and constantly second guessing myself to the point where I can barely make a decision at all.*

All of this has made me a really paranoid and anxiety stricken person, I worry about a lot of things, particularly my future as well as future success and what i'm going to do with my life. I think i know what I want to do in life but im always second guessing myself. 

Someone asked me the other day how I would describe myself, and I couldn't even tell them anything, I don't even know who i am anymore and I forgot who I was. 

Perhaps my biggest problem is that I don't make meaningful relationships with the people i meet generally. People usually forget my name and I generally forget theres. I wish it was important to me but I can't bring myself to genuinely care sometimes and I feel myself constantly waiting for social situations to finally be over. 

I'm not sure if anyone will read this but I guess I'm just looking for some advice or some help. I'm in what feels like a *mid-life-crisis* and I don't know what to do to get out of it. 

How do I find myself again?
How can I find what makes me happy or what makes me laugh?

I know these are probably things that I need to find out myself but I just don't know where to turn to.

I would really appreciate any responses :(

**TL;DR I'm just not happy anymore, I've lost myself and I don't know what to do about it. I'm terribly insecure and unsure of myself at all times.**",depression,depression,0.90
59,"Anyone noticed?Does anybody else noticed that when you tell your ""internet friend"" that you're feeling a little down, (not heavily depressed just a little down) they tend to ignore you. I told 2 or 3 of them that I'm not feeling good and they all react the same. To one I said ""I'm sorry if made you feel awkward but it's really no big deal. I mean it's normal not to feel 100% happy everyday right?"" then she talked with me but stayed somewhat distant.

So now I won't tell anyone but professionals about, these folk decided to dedicate their life to helping others. I'm sure they'll be more helping.

60,"I realized that I lost my personalityFirst post here. So I have a history of depression, I was diagnosed with and medicated for it in high school and I managed to overcome it, or so I thought. Looking back I had a few other depressive episodes in the last five years but nothing debilitating like it was before. I started slipping back into depression about six months ago (I'm not sure when/why it started, but it started slow) and before I knew it I was back in that pit of despair. It was so subtle that when I reached my deepest darkest place I thought that that was the life is, was and always will be. I had no notion that life could be (and at one time was) anything but suffering. Shortly before I started feeling the depression I was at the top of my game. I was killing it in school, athletics, and to top it all off my best friend and I started dating, my first real relationship. Well, the depression started and my life started going down hill. My grades slipped, I lost interest in all of the things that made me feel fulfilled, but the worst of all it caused my best friend, the girl I loved, to break up with me. All through this I knew deep down that I was experiencing depression again but was in denial, it told myself I was stronger than that, that I beat it before and it was gone for good. I was wrong. After that I knew that I needed help, I started seeing a psychologist and oh my God was that a game changer. I'm still in that pit, but in the past week I started having periods of lucidity. There were two 24-hour periods where I sort of ""woke up."" The world's color came back, I didn't feel that impending sense of doom anymore. I felt like part of my brain had been turned off for the past few months and someone had just switched it on. All I wanted to do was go running to my ex and scream ""I'm back! I'm back! I'm sorry that I left you like that, that I hurt you, but I'm finally back and it'll be ok now. We can finally have the relationship that we both wanted."" During this moment of lucidity I realized that not only was my mood low, but I had lost my sense of ""me,"" like I was on partial autopilot for a while and then I had suddenly grabbed back the controls. I'm not completely sure what triggered the ""wake up,"" it probably has to do with me being able to disassociate myself with my depression, something I learned in therapy. Unfortunately I slipped back into that pit, but it feels less.... personal? Like I instead of feeling like I'm in total blackness I feels like I just have my vision obscured my something dark. I know there is daylight even if I can't see it. Right now I'm waiting to wake up again, to get my personality back. I know it's there, just buried somewhere in my brain.",depression,depression,0.90
61,"Does anyone else depend on alcohol to feel okay in social situations?If I'm at a social gathering where everyone is drinking, like a pub crawl or a party, I can't have a good time without alcohol. My depressive mood just lifts for the moment and I can easily be the center of the group and really enjoy myself. I'm on anti-depressants and I've heard that they don't mix to well with alcohol, and I've noticed that because I'll feel suicidal for a few days after.

But the problem is if I don't drink I feel like an outsider, I get so bored. Sometimes I doubt that the alcohol will affect my medication as I've abstained for weeks and still feel like shit, I convince myself that drinking is okay and my mood gets lifted.

65,"After years battling depression and anxiety I feel like I am still failing at every attempt to improve my life. Have to have a difficult conversation with SO about it tonight and don't know what to do.Sorry for how long this is going to be in advance.

Background: Mental illness runs in my family. My mom has been an alcoholic since she was a teen (had to have hips replaced before she was 30 because of it on top of tons of other health issues) and diagnosed with everything from schizpohrenia to bipolar although the diagnosis that stuck was Borderline Personality Disorder. Some days she was my best friend and others she was verbally/emotionally abusive. Dad is a perpetual victim who is completely codependent on my mother.

The only two good things I had were my grandmother who was a refuge when things got too bad at home and my apparent intelligence. I was IQ tested in 1st grade and ever since then all I heard was how that was my out; I was intelligent enough to do well in school and could be better than my parents. 

Then when I was 14 I woke up to grandma being taken out on a stretcher after having a severe stroke in the night. She couldn't say anything but ""yeah"" after that and I had to go back to living with parents full time. I definitely already had anxiety issues before this but afterwards I had a full break down, I began cutting and developing bad habits with food and finally became suicidal.

My parents didn't really understand what was going on. So I found a therapist online. I couldnt bring myself to tell her about the cutting and suicidal thoughts at first. Finally I wrote it on a piece of paper and shoved it at her in the middle of a session. I told her I needed to go away and that I already knew of a place. I was inpatient the next day.

I was in and out of the hospital 3 times in one year. Finally went to a group home for girls with mental health issues for six months. Dropped out of school.

Eventually got my GED and tried to go back to school but I just haven't been able to get through it. Semester after semester I seem to screw up.

Eventually met my dream SO; he is supportive, sensitive and understanding. He always thinks the best of me.

Now: I've screwed up again. I thought I could do it and now I'm in a hole I can't dig myself out of. I missed classes because the anxiety would keep me from sleeping at night and I couldnt face the almost 2 hour commute. I didn't do enough homework because I was apathetic.

I'm not sure why I keep doing this but I can't keep doing it. I can't even keep doctors appointments and other basic things and I think that's a clear sign that college may be too ambitious.

The problem is that I internalize everything and just keep saying everything is fine until it is very not fine like right now.

I'm afraid to tell him I've gotten myself in this situation again. He won't leave me or anything like that but he will be so disappointed. Worse, I think he has too much faith in me. I think he's convinced that I could do this if I were just persistent enough about overcoming my anxiety to do what I need to do. But either I can't or I won't and if the latter then I think that in of itself is a problem.

Or perhaps I'm making up more excuses. I feel like I can't tell what is legitimate and what is laziness.

I'm not sure what to think anymore and I trust my own judgement the least. One second I'm convinced I need to go to therapy and a psychiatrist again. Another I think I just need to stop being such a lazy entitled brat.

Sorry, it seems like there is little point to any of this. I guess I am just looking for feedback or validation...or something. I don't know.

tl;dr - I screw up a lot. I thought I might be finally making real progress but I've screwed up again. Not sure wha to think or how to talk to amazing SO.",depression,depression,0.90
66,"please hold meI don't use reddit a lot and I don't know if this subreddit is for me so please forgive me for posting here. I'm using a throwaway account (obviously) because I wish to remain anonymous. I don't even know why I'm posting here, nothing makes sense to me anymore... i don't even know why i was using capital letters there as i never do that i probably just want to fit in here but i'm going to respect myself and end that right then and there, let's get to the point

i am an 18 year old male and i don't know anything anymore. i feel lost, crazy and lonely. i have had a lot of ""traumatic"" experiences happen to me and i'm honestly here just to see people  say ""it will all be ok"" to me. i am highly intellectual, attractive (i've been told both thousands of times but that means absolutely nothing to me) i know people have it worse i have so much stuff going on in my head i feel like i'm going to reach absolute madness.

i am afraid of my own intellectual capacity, i am able to see the world in many different ways, my personality is very fluid i have tried numerous tests throughout the years and it has never been consistent. the only thing i want in life is to become an actor probably because i was bullied all throughout middle school for absolutely nothing. i was always nice to everyone never wanted any trouble... i was forced to fight for my survival in middle school going as far as to get into fights with my classmates, these fights were not brutal but they would make fun of me and call me a retard, a faggot, they would say that my mom bought my teachers off to give me good grades, saying that she sucked their dicks and other disgusting shit all in front of the teachers. nobody gave a fuck. nobody cared for me. i would skip school by any means possible: faking sicknesses, lying, pretending... i've learned to lie and pretend a lot... i would beg my mom to let me stay home and she did let me finish the school year 2 months earlier than the rest of the kids.

i never went to kindergarten

i live in eastern europe where life isn't all that good (it's better now that i have grown and accepted that as long as i have food on the table i'll be fine)

i cannot write this out fluently as there are so many things just trying to get out of me at once. i just want to be heard

im attractive but i'm skinny and every guy my age is 10 times stronger than me (even though i am confident i would be able to defend myself effectively) 

i have been keeping this inside of me for about 10 years, never had anyone to talk to besides my abusive mother who i just want to get away from

i have never had a girlfriend, i cannot talk to them, most of the time i can't even look at people. the social interactions i've been in the past 4-6 years amount to absolute ZERO (i've never been out, i don't count saying hi to people to pretend to be nice a social interaction) i don't talk to people because of my self-consciousness, lack of self-esteem, i have NO confidence (i can fake it though)

the worst part is i have to put on a smile wherever i go

my mother does everything for me and i've got no freedom (i can't go outside unless i'm walking the dog, i don't get allowance) she signed me up for the DMV so i could get a driver's license and today's lesson was about giving first aid so we could get out first aid certificates. the doctor gave us papers to write our names down in, i was the first one she gave it to, i put my name down and then she gave me another paper just like that so i signed it again. thing is both of them were part of the same list and she called me out in front of everyone for signing my name twice. truth is i realized what i was doing but i was too afraid to speak out loud, i was too afraid to say that i had already signed it.

my grandmother committed suicide in the room next to mine which gave me actual PTSD, i do the thousand yard stares a lot when i'm thinking about her (she jumped out of the 5th floor window, she internally bled and suffocated on her own blood.) i used to hear her outside the window at night saying (let me in) i used to hear her bed creak as it always did whenever she was getting up... this would happen hundreds of times each day i never could go to that room because i would be frozen in fear, my mind going totally fucking numb, me hearing shit that wasn't even there
it got so bad that i had to check up on my mom constantly because i kept hearing the splat sound my grandmother made when she hit the ground and i thought my mom was going to kill herself too. this happened september when i started going to the first year of high school, didn't help me get any friends and i again became the quiet retarded child

i've contemplated suicide hundreds of times and i'm afraid of myself. i was staring out of my balcony window and i was sure i was going to kill myself casually just like that, my leg was over the balcony already, the cold wind made me snap back and realize what i was doing

i was a prodigy in my drama classes, i was an absolute GOD at acting but i had to force myself to be worse because i would stand out again

i am super manipulative, playing the strings on my classmates to do stuff for me, making empty promises, i've noticed i am extremely good at manipulation.

i feel a lot, i cry during movies, i feel tears in my eyes if i have to talk to strangers, i feel every emotion amplified times 10. i fall in love with every girl, doesn't matter if she's pretty or not, smart or dumb.

i've acted in numerous plays and noticed that even though my hands tremble, i am terrified, my body's shaking, my face is making distorted facial expressions because i'm trying to hold it together i am still able to perform extraordinarily well 

i just want someone to hear me

i am afraid of my ""fluid"" personality that i mentioned before. i can make myself like and dislike things at the blink of an eye. i feel empty and full, i feel stupid and smart, i feel the duality in me is just too much for me to bear

i feel madness (crazyness) i feel like my mind is on a line which, if crossed, i won't be able to return from. maybe i should cross it. maybe life will be beautiful again then as i will not be sane enough to know it's not.

i can't take this anymore... i have so many more things to tell you but my dog really wants to go outside. and i know that if i don't post this now, i will delete it once i get back. time for me to avoid eye contact and keep my head down again, looking at people's backs with ""please hold me, please talk to me, please love me"" in my eyes as they walk past me and i remain unnoticed, empty, a piece of hay in a haystack.

I came across this subreddit some time ago and poked around before deciding to post. I need to get this off my chest; I'm sorry if this isn't the place to do it.

I've been a pathological liar my entire life. Sometimes I just blurt things, almost out of a sense of need to be accepted, and other times I want to be in the limelight of a conversation. I openly admit I am egotistical, not overly so, not to the point where I rub it in people's faces and make a fool of myself, but I often spend most of my time in the bathroom looking in the mirror, if I'm alone.

For backstory, I was diagnosed with depression when I was twelve-thirteen/ sent to a therapist around that same time, but I was depressed for about two years before that. I don't know if I should link this to my lying. My parents recently pulled me out of therapy without explanation, and I haven't been stable since. It feels like everything's crumbling around me. I feel like a failure and a burden to everyone who's close to me, and I've tried to self-harm multiple times in the past few months.

I will attempt to make this as brief as possible as I can make this an entire novel if need be.

I have been suffering from depression for quite some time. I still do.

The difference between me and the majority of people who suffer is that I am still happy.

I've have had the fortunate pleasure and liberty of exploring the world.
I have met many people, I have visited many countries, and I have discovered many cultures.

I was, (and hopefully you will) be pleasantly surprised to know that these common feelings we all hold true, are very common amongst the world, and all these cultures.

I can't make this 100 pages long, so if anyone has questions, comments, or needs help, let me know PM me or contact me.

I plan on making a website soon with my studies, and beliefs.

That's all for now!!!

83,"Do you feel like you are teetering on the edge of depression?Last year i hit an emotional low and finally went for the anti-depressants. I was on a few different onces every two weeks because my doctor couldn't make up her mind and i had all the side effects i didn't want. I stayed on them for about 3 months while i worked on getting life settled and then stopped taking them. 

It's been a year since i stopped taking them and I think i can say that i'm doing great without them. I haven't slipped back into a full depression anyways. But i can't help but feel that I'm tip-toeing on the very fine edge between ok and not and one small event would probably be the breaking point. I don't know what that event could be but i don't want it to happen.

It's not quite the same as 'swimming up stream' but its more like i can't help but think that everyday could be the day when i finally cross the line. I'm functioning but i'm not doing fantastic. I would like to start working out more and I need to figure out how to feed myself. For the last year i've either hired somebody to cook a bunch of food and leave it in my fridge or i've been eating fast food and take out. I would love to cook in my kitchen but i think i have some sort of strong anxiety against that and i dont know how to get over it.

I had a fantastic therapist last year and we decided to see how i did without further visits when i stopped taking my meds. It worked great but I'd love to meet with her again, as a follow up and with more things to talk about. I've contacted her so many times in the last 3 months that I'm convinced she must have died because she is not responding to me at all and that is the most frustrating thing of all. I probably don't need to speak to a therapist but the fact that mine is MIA is causing me more stress than anything.

I've been depressed since childhood. On and off medication, in and out of therapy, out patient programs, etc. I've been in recovery from self injury for over a decade with only a few short lived relapses. I have had several episodes of suicidal ideation and a few times I had a plan and got pretty close. I'm currently on antidepressants. But sometimes that shit just don't work.

My only two goals in life are sort of crumbling before my eyes and I feel like a failure.  I'm feeling like I don't have much to look forward to anymore. 

I'm having tons of inexplicable medical problems. Racked up tons of medical bills with no diagnosis and no resolution. I'm in constant pain.

I'm not attracted to my wife--I love her a lot, but I have zero libido, and if I want to get off, I find I can almost only do it while imagining sex with men. 

I was accidentally responsible for putting her in a situation that got her hurt her recently and I feel like she doesn't trust me anymore. God that feels terrible.  I'm also pretty sure that she has concluded that she doesn't want to have children with me anymore. It's unrelated to the accident, but those two things sort of feed into a lot of self-loathing.

My job sucks and I feel trapped in this career that I hate because I can't imagine any careers that I'd hate less, that wouldn't cost me more than my life savings and decades of reeducation.

I have no friends and my wife is basically all I've got going for me and I am just fucking that relationship up, too.

I have a new folding knife--a gift from her. Its blades are literally razor sharp, maybe sharper even. Just opening it up, I accidentally sliced myself and drew blood--barely felt a thing.  I haven't intentionally cut myself in years. Now I'm sitting here trying to convince myself not to do it again and again and again.  I can't have a fucking cigarette or a joint or a drink.  God knows I'd love t), but I've tried so hard to stop those behaviors, too, that the guilt would be unbearable. I think I feel like I'd be less of a failure if I cut myself than if I fell off any of those other wagons. And I don't have a pack of cigs or a joint or a bottle lying conveniently in my lap. 

I feel like I just want... Something that I can't quite define. But I'm pretty sure that cutting won't be the answer even though part of my brain is convinced it will help.

86,"I've been dealing with it for 6 years, here's my experienceHi guys,

1st things first: I live in Brazil. So excuse my poor english and grammar. I'll put the tips first and my backstory later. 

**So, what I learnt from my experience all those years?**

**1. Any reason to live is a good one.**

The thoughts of suicide still comes from time to time but they are starting to feel more spaced out. And everytime I think about ""how good it would be to die now"" I start to think about all the things I'll miss if I do. And they are just... simple: Fallout 4, a weekend with my family, taking my dog for a walk, eating a Whopper. Growing up and having responsabilities sucks hard, but I only have one life and I want to do the best I can with it.

**2. Don't feel guilty about feeling sad.**

Everytime I went into some sad trip I felt guilty afterwards: ""How can I be depressed about my work when there are families that are starving to death?""
It just made me worse. Every people grew up and had different experiences than yours. You can't compare your problem to theirs. Your problem matter too. 

**3. Depression doesn't heal overnight.**

Mine didn't. And still hasn't. But I'm not expecting it to vanish. I've learnt to deal with it everyday. Sometimes I hate myself and my routine, but no one will live it for me, so I ""man up"" and face things like a champ.

Like Deadpool said in the movie: ""Life is an endless series of train-wrecks with only brief, commercial-like breaks of happiness.""

And that's it. Don't expect to live a perfect life. Nobody has it. People can live in better conditions that you do (money, work, relationships...) but they got their dose of problems too (like in bulletpoint 2 above...)

**4. Battling depression is better when you are not alone.**

The perfect person to help you is a therapist. No doubt about it. They'll shed some light on your life and your choices. Now I'm not seeing one since I don't have money to spend (paying for a house that I don't live in yet :( ) on sessions. But anyone (or anything) helped me too: my wife, my dog, myself in the mirror. Talking about my problems makes me realize the issue with them and how can I solve them. Thinking about them overnight never helped, but talking does.

**5. You are never alone. Never.**

You can probably have a life with no friends, no family, but it doesn't mean that no one will try to help you if you scream for help. Internet helps a lot. Here is a perfect place for it. Just because they'll never met you doesn't mean that they don't understand you.
As I said, talk about your problems, take them off your chest.


**Backstory** 

About 7 years ago I broke up with my 1st serious girlfriend. We were together for almost 4 years but we were kids and it wasn't going to work. If I was a little more mature I would ended soon but at least I did end it. I spent a month thinking about life and how I could improve and starting to hit the gym and got some results. I weighed about 85kg that time, and had a OK body (now that I'm sitting at 100kg, I miss those times). All girls started to look at me. I was feeling great. 

Dropped the gym and started partying hard. I spent almost everyday drinking after class. Met a lot of people and one of my best friends until today.

After a few months a girl from my class invited me to a country party at a thursday. It wasn't the first time, but it was the first time that we went as a couple. I've never intended to move past friendship with her, but just happened. We kissed that night and my life went into ""blur mode"".

I've fell in love madly with her. And she dumped me 2 months later. I was devastated. I drank even more. I started passing out at every opportunity I could. I slept at work. My life was a mess.

A friend of mine knew a therapist and I scheduled a session. She was just perfect. I spent 6 months going to our sessions and I grew up lots. Saw a lot of my problems and how to deal with my depression.

I was living again, going out with my friends healthly and was enjoying being me.

One night, when I drank just a little more. That ""country girl"" just popped in front of me at a party. I was dancing with my friends and just enjoying the night and she came and said how I was different and gave me a kiss and left. I just shrugged it off and my friends went out of their minds how I could do that. 

When I was at the line for paying for our booze she popped again and grabbed me and we kissed again. She said that she wanted another shot, that she would be different.

We met again 3 days later at a coffee shop. We talked a lots and she said she was in love with me. She want to try again and she wouldn't make the same mistake again.

I was more than happy. I was just blazing. A week later she got a job at a huge company and she called me first, saying that I felt more important than anyone else. We would spent hours talking in the phone.

Felt great. For a time.

After our first sex she started to act weird. Or I was too ""sticky"". It doesn't matter. I talked about that to my therapist and she said that if I was always running after her, I should let her ran to me once, ask me out again, that stuff.

So, we met at a sushi bar and it felt great. We talked a lot and said that we could date again that weekend.

It was the **last time** we spoke.

I've fell harder than the first time. And it still hurts me to this day. 

Since we weren't at a serious relationship I was dating another girls and she was dating another guys too, no big deal. After 3 months I started dating my current wife and she helps me with my everyday battle with myself.

**Aftermath**

I still have troubles trusting in people. I love my wife to death. She's my everything now, but I still have a couple friends and this number is not growing. I think I push people away because of all my problems. And since we are short on money and having a problematic puppy doesn't help me when my friends invite me to a bar. But hey, it's for a good purpose! It'll get better soon next year, when we'll start building our home :D

87,"Basic truths on depression and how to get over it?I recently stumbled upon this sub Reddit and decided to join it to add what meager wisdom I have as someone who is recovering. I'm wondering if anyone has started an FAQ like guild to getting over depression that would be available on the side bar. I think it would be beneficial to have some sort of ebook or wiki that we could record the things that tend to come up often. Something like the FAQ and other side bar post on seddit. 

I'll put my 2 cents in to start if anyone is interested. I found that realizing that I was in control of my life and taking control of it was integral to being happier.

I realized I've been depressed since I was 14 years old.

The good news is, now I know. I can see the patterns and recognize the behavior. I'm getting help, and taking steps toward mental health. I understand this will be a struggle, but I accept the work that lies ahead.

I was always a normal happy person up to that point. After that incident I got severe anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts ect ect.

I will say the med did help me, but overall since getting off of it I'm not where I want to be. A quick runoff of what I have gone through after getting off of it

- stomach problems, acid
- pain on and off in the kidney areas
- massive fatigue
- shortness of breath
- headaches on and off
- pre hypertension 
- weakened sense of smell and taste

So up to about a month and half ago I started to discover supplements like 5htp. So I finally started to try and educate myself about neurotransmitters and I've seen a lot of discussion here about them and what the symptoms and deficiencies of each one were.

I decided to try 5htp, took one 50mg pill at night as suggested and I simply couldn't sleep at all. I believe to have had opposite effects? I know ppl take it for sleep problems but luckily I don't suffer any sleep problems, my fatigue actually makes me want to sleep more often or longer periods of time. So the next day I was all kinds of messed up and tired/foggy

So I ditched that and purcheased L Tyrosine last week, it immediately mellowed me out and I was a couch potato. Extreme tiredness and some shortness of breath. It started to wear off but then the next morning my eyes were extremely dry and sensitive to light, and just throbbing. Now it's been over a week and I'm still having some of these symptoms with my eyes. They take turns from left to right. Episodes of blurred vision, pain/headachs, zoning out.

I never said anything about my suicidal thoughts, because thats something i didnt want them to have to worry about.

Anyway, i wish someone would just shoot me or stab me to death, and then i could die without it being a suicide, and it wouldnt be my fault for all the sadness.

Or i eish my parents didnt love me so i could kill myself, i have practically no friends and after a few months nobody would really care.

My boss is a type-A-workaholic-micromanaging-passive-aggresive (I have some other adjectives but I will refrain from using them) woman who questions every little damn thing that I do with my job. She's been prying into why I've been having so many appointments lately, but I don't feel like I have to tell her that they're for counseling/therapy and medical checkups. I always make sure all my work is done, I don't miss deadlines and I always give her prior notice. And I have LOADS of leave hours accrued from rarely taking time off.

112,"Once we recognize we're having an episode, what are some things we can do to ease the pain? I want your help and ideas, maybe we can help each other :)Hello...

I'm a 24yo male and I've battled depression through most of my life. I've just recently (within a year or two) been able to recognize when I'm hurdling through the abyss: I become hyper-irritable, destructive, inconsolable/drawn inward, just completely debilitated mentally and physically. It's like I'm a different person, and it's next to impossible for me to realize what's going on until it's happening for a while (a few hours at least) BUT I think I'm getting better at recognizing the signs/symptoms in myself. By destructive I mean I will try to fix something or do something, get impatient and super determined, things spiral from there. I never hurt myself or anyone else, I just break shit that I'm trying to fix because I feel like I NEED to do something, to make something right, so I just get caught in a spiral of little projects that I hope will make me feel.... whole? fulfilled? at peace about SOMETHING?


Being able to recognize my sickness and just knowing why I'm feeling this way is a big help in itself, but I really need help figuring out what to do about it. I don't have any medication, cannabis helps but sometimes feels like a quick fix. I don't want to self medicate and never find a way to cope. These episodes can be a few hours, days, or weeks. 

My suggestion: When this is happening, it always helps to remember that I'm not alone. So we should come up with some reddit-related thing we say to ourselves. Knowing that someone else out there is saying or doing the same thing to cope, maybe that will be enough to help sometimes?

I was super relaxed, but I was also in the dark. Would that be what hell is like? Absolute isolation...would that be so terrible? I wish there was no consciousness.

I don't know the system in America, but here in Canada the wait times are usually 3-5 months, and I have only waited for one. My GP is an idiot.

119,"Every decision I make, I feel like I'm digging a deeper hole.I've recently lost all will to make life better. Since forever ago I've been depressed due to many things, such as drugs, loneliness, major losses (death of my grandpa, break up, etc) lack of connection with my siblings and parents. I wasn't the best student so my parents weren't really proud of me, telling me how much I disappointed them since they gave so much up for me and my siblings. They moved from away from poverty and made something out of themselves here in America, so I can see why they are disappointed. During my sophomore year in high school, my grandfather died, and I had no one to talk to anymore since he was the only person that listened. I resorted to drugs and drinking to feel like I was the king of the world, only to realize after my high that my life was full of loneliness and sorrow. I never had much close friends, and the very few I had never thought I was since I didn't want to worry them, so I just acted happy, and every time I tried to make a new friend, I was just shrugged of as some weird loner. I realized that I had to somehow get out of this hole of depression, I didn't want to be sad, or hate myself. I wanted to live a life I couldn't regret. But no one ever listened, no one ever talked to me, and I became even more sad. 

I ended up turning things around, when a girl actually asked me out to homecoming my senior year. I didn't know what I did, but something happened that sort of pulled me out of the quicksand I was stuck in. She was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. I felt like I was actually something. But my demons never left me, and fast forward a year later and I ended up being a terrible boyfriend. During that year I kept trying to make something of myself to finally impress my parents, but everything I did I just separated myself from everyone and everything I knew. I grew more and more distant trying to make a name for myself and I didn't realize that I was pushing away my own girlfriend. I broke her heart because at the time, I was so determined to finally make my parents proud that I said to myself, I need to work by myself so forward myself. I was so ignorant of her feelings, and up until the actual breakup, I never realized how stupid and insanely terrible of a human being I was to her. She was always there for me and never ever put me down, yet I was so blinded by my own ambitions that I couldn't see that. I utterly broke her heart, and she said that I was basically dead to her after that, that she didn't want to know me anymore.

I ended up getting laid off at my job as well. What used to be insane determination to become happy once again ended up in me making the most idiotic decisions that ultimately were my own fault. I've lost so much motivation, I've tried a therapist, medication, etc., but my will had been shattered because I thought I was doing the right thing..

Now every day I keep thinking to myself, why? Why did I end up in such a deep hole, dug by myself. Why did I make such stupid choices. Why couldn't I just do the right thing.. Every time I talk to my mom, who's a lot more understanding than my dad, about my depression, all I get is, ""I'm here for you, everything's going to get better."" While it does sound reassuring, I don't get any more than just words. I feel like the dumbest man alive sometimes. Every night I keep wishing that my grandpa was alive, so someone can actually listen and guide me, or that I never broke up with my ex due to my blindness towards her. I've regreted every single decision I've made since everything I've done turned me in the wrong direction. I've tried so hard to leave the hole I dug, but I've only made it deeper, and I've lost all hope of ever leaving it.

Right now, I'm suffering at my job. I'm pretty sure I will be gone in two weeks. I have been missing work from being sick, not just from depression. I'm always constantly late to work too. I love my job, but it's so exhausting showing up when my coworkers make it such a terrible place. It's a huge contribution to my attendance problems. I work with people that are passive-aggressive, unhappy, make unnecessary negative comments, condescendingly nit-pick at how I do things (even if there are other ways to do it), talk shit, don't guide me with the right direction (bad leadership qualities) and treat my happy energy as fake, annoying, undesirable, etc.

I love what I do, but hate the people I work with. Myself and two other people are the only ones who promote positive energy and connectivity. I know the workplace isn't a place to make friends, but none of us click, and the ones that do just complain about shit with each other. If I'm around, it's usually me, and I am fully welcomed with condescending looks and spoken to like, *she's so happy, so that must mean she's incredibly dumb.* Yep, I work with *those* people.

I came into work recently and I was told my job is halted until corporate figures out if I'm worth keeping or not. Most likely not. I haven't even started on Plan B. Truthfully, I'm not depressed about it. The depressing part is finding another job where I'm surrounded by these kinds of people again, just like everywhere else I've worked.

*I know people have their own stories and deal with it differently,* but it's so unfair I have serious mental issues like suicidal thoughts and depression (amongst other things) and they act the way they do, and they're much older than me (we're all adult ages). I'm usually accepting of that behavior, but negativity is just part of their personality, not out of tragic occurrence. It's so painful to imagine I have to go through with that again - same shit, different place - and I'm adult enough to deal with them without confrontation. I have terrible things going on, but I leave it at the door, and I don't let it influence how I behave with others and how I work. It's just the professional thing to do. I wish people learned that.

122,"Need advice, maybe just someone to talk to.Questioning ending it all. First I suppose I should tell my story. It’s not too peculiar but I can’t help but look back and feel anger and regret. I was born in Oklahoma, the third kid of six, to my mom and dad, 24 and 44 at the time. They married four years prior. My dad is the definition of a fuck up that money somehow saved. His parents were very wealthy, religious oil tycoons and left my dad and his brother millions. My dad’s brother died and he spent his share building a church for a cultish nut. He threw the money at random, bullshit. Even starting a miniature horse foundation. The ass never thought to save it for our college. After wasting about three million he moves us, I was four, to a small island called Bainbridge right off of Seattle. We spent six years there while he built a homeschooling company. My mom ended up doing all the work and he sat around all day reading about mysticism and other nonsense which I actually believed in back then. It was my two older sisters and my younger brother for most of my time there. My younger sister was born in year 4 of living there. My parents were paranoid and stuck-up assholes to everyone. I was homeschooled my entire time there and by “homeschooled” I mean my mom taught me to read and then I had to go from there. I did this until fifth grade when we moved to Florida because my dad thought that the new “catholic” town of Ave Maria would make us be closer to god. It was awful and we left after eleven months. I made my first friends there. I was a religious ass at that time and am still surprised any people were nice enough to not hate me, though there certainly was bullying. We then moved to Colorado, where my dad thought it would be best to find a cabin in the mountains twenty minutes from the gate which opened to Manitou Springs. So my complete isolation continued for a while. I had my siblings, don’t get me wrong, but I never had any close connection with someone because I am too different from my siblings for me to really talk to them. This continued until I was fourteen. This gave me a dilemma. I was never very popular with my parents. They never cared about me in the same way as my other siblings. You’d think maybe I’m just really quiet and they can’t get me to talk but I’m not. They basically forgot about me for many years and when they got around to give me school work I was three years behind. Three years I had to work. I had to skip third and sixth grade to try to get as close as I could to on track. When they finally realized that homeschooling is the worst way to raise a kid they sent me to the strictest charter school they could find. A 6th-12th grade hellhole was what they chose. I chose to go into eighth instead of finally correcting my age problem because I truly was disgusted with the ninth grade, more so than the eighth. Everyone was convinced they were the second coming of Christ’s intelligence. I had to slowly gain friends. It was a very small class and only got smaller as many left to go to other places for high-school. If only I had been able to convince my parents to let me leave I could possibly be happy now. Four years later and here I am. Around the start of the semester my friend who left in ninth grade introduced me to his girlfriend’s twin sister and we started dating almost immediately. We are nearly as opposite as you can get as far as interests go but we seem to think the same and it’s great. Now this year, end of junior year, I’m turning 18 this weekend and I’m not sure I want to continue. The school I went to had a system where half of your grade is based on “wonder”, which is basically how much teacher dick you suck up. I test always in the top two in my class and yet I have a goddamn 3.96 out of 5.0. Nothing’s fucking fair. I got a 30 on the ACT this week and I still get called stupid. I’m nothing special but I’m not stupid for fucks sake. My girlfriend is moving to Washington at the end of senior year with her mom and she’ll be attending college there. I’m stuck here. My dad refuses to let me or any of us have the college money our granddad promised us. I have to go to UCCS until I can finally actually get my grades based on tests not fucking “wonder”. I want to go to Stanford for aerospace and/or computer engineering related courses for my Masters. I’m rambling here but I can’t help it. My entire life has been fucked over because my parents never gave a shit. Hell, they forgot my birthday two years in a row now. Now, I finally get to leave that hellhole of a school and be with my old friends and girlfriend and I’ve never been so sad. I’m going to be taking college mathematics and AP courses only next year if I can and I won’t even be able to see my friends much, they’re all in IB which I can’t get in because they don’t accept Seniors. After this year I’ll be alone with my family, all my friends are mainly going out of state, including of course my girlfriend who is basically all that keeps me going at this point. If she leaves for college what if she finds someone better? What if we just naturally drift apart? I don’t want these questions to asked or answered. I need help. I’m so fucking scared. I’m so angry. I hate being angry. I’ve always been proud of not being an angry person. I’ve always tried to be that arrogant asshole but what have I accomplished to be proud of?

But I feel like I just talk so much about my problems and she helps me with all of them but then I feel like a bad person because I never help her despite asking her to talk to me about her problems so maybe I could feel a little better knowing I'm helping too, but she never wants to talk about them. And j just don't know what to do because I feel like such a horrible person for taking so much and never giving back. Also, I try to keep my issues hidden from other people because I don't want them to think any differently of me. I had a really good friend who told everybody about her problems and someone got her help. Long story short, the doctor prescribed her depression medication that ended up giving her scitzophrenia. (sorry if I misspelled that.) but I refuse to let that happen to me. Also, because of my dependency, I get very bad anxiety if I don't get enough nicotine in a day (I dip). If I don't get at least two or three lips in per day, I get really stressed. But it's hard to do because almost nobody knows that I do it and I don't want anybody finding out because a lot of people think it's ""gross"" but I can't just stop. Somebody please give me advice with these things. It would be much appreciated.",depression,depression,0.90

128,"Trying hard to stay positive...When I was 15 I survived Black Saturday, a large bushfire in Australia. 

I had to watch as school friends were buried. I had to watch as the ruins of my town where driven away in trucks, everyday waiting for the school bus.

My teachers gave me shit, for not being able to 'focus'. I'd been diagnosed with PTSD, not being able to focus was the least of my problems.

At 16 my father left, and stole all our money, even $1000 I had been given for surviving the fires. 

I ended up failing high school, I used to be top of my class. I excelled in some classes, but I didn't finish enough units to get my ATAR. Not that it matters much anyway.

My mother has severe depression, which she's had my entire life. I've had to take the role of caregiver, it got so bad after my father left she started pulling out her hair and cutting herself. I had no clue what to do. I workked hard, saved up money, and helped us move to a new town.

I'm now 19 at this point, despite working 2 years in the hospitality industry, no one would hire me. Newstart was a joke (welfare payment) I couldn't get rent assistance. 

Eventually I'm able to make enough money to just cover rent and expenses. And I start saving.

A year and a half after moving. And we get told we have to move, the landlord is selling the house. So all the money I'd saved up, was spent on that. 

There were hardly any houses available, and everything is over priced. I'm now paying more for a house that's falling apart.

The septic tank here has a fault where the toilet keeps blocking. Landlord refuses to fix properly.After trying to sort it out with the estate agent, I send in a Breach of Duty notice, following legal advice provided by Consumer Affairs. I also report my estate agent to their head office, for taking over 5 days to organize an urgent repair.

2 weeks later, the notice had been ignored. I contact consumer affairs again, they call the estate agent, 5 minutes later the boss of my agent arrives. Without notice...

He starts yelling at me demanding to see a blocked toilet, accusing us of sabotaging this house. A week earlier rotten wood had given way under me, (there's a verandah outside the front door, and I fell and injured my leg)
I tired to explain the breach wasn't about the toilet still being blocked, it was about the fault that kept causing that issue. He basically calls me a liar, and keeps raising his voice when I'm trying to talk.
In hindsight, I should have called the police on him for tresspassing.

He starts screaming at me that ""I need to pull my fucking head in.""

I of course end up telling him to get fucked.

Anyway.... I know this is sort of long and disjointed. But I'm just miserable. I've been trying to do the right thing. Work hard, save money, nothing is working. And now I'm fighting with an Estate Agent because I had a dispute with the landlord. This guy isn't even meant to be involved in this. So now this has to go to court.

I'm sick of all this crap. i'm sick of being broke. I'm so stressed that I feel sick everyday, I can't enjoy anything. Music sucks, reading sucks, playng videogames sucks. I am bored, I am lonely, and I am tired of life. 

I am sick of people telling me to stay positive, when they have no idea what being poor is like.

I am sick of not having a home I can go back to. All my friends have a ""family home"" they have a security. I have to keep fighting to keep a roof over my head. I hardly have any family left. My mother's family is in Ireland, and she didn't leave them on good terms. 

I'm just sick of it. I see my friends all doing wonderful things, going to uni, going travelling. And I'm stuck here. Trying to get by from day to day. I'm just miserable. I hardly sleep, I'm barely eating. I'm always wired. I feel like the symptoms of my PTSD are back.

I normally am better at staying positive. But it seems no matter how hard I work, no matter what I do. It always ends badly. Everything in this house costs more, and I havn't been able to save at all. Everythings just getting worse. I'm sick of people treating me like shit for being poor. I never had a choice in the matter. I worked hard, and it didn't get me anywhere. ",depression,depression,0.90

I'm 24, male, and married. I'm currently working towards a degree in computer science, while working full time as a catering specialist. I just got a promotion at work to traveling chef-manager (I run accounts while chefs go on vacation). I'm losing weight (intentionally). Work and school are the only things I enjoy anymore. My parents are divorced, and my father has a new girlfriend and a new life. He is always cold and awkward towards me, and I feel like I'm just a relic from the worst chapter in his life, and that I should let him go. The rest of my family I feel I can't trust anymore. They have been extremely unsupportive of my diet (I was obese, currently overweight at 230lbs). There was one ugly incident with my brother lecturing me that I was sick for wanting to get down to a healthy weight. They all try to schedule me into food-outings or even literally send me candy bars. I have willpower problems, so going and not eating never works. (I work around food all day long. My willpower lasts through a 12 hour shift, but not the following social dinner).

I'm hitting all these milestones, doing all these new things, but my wife just sits at home and rewatches the same T.V. series. It's upsetting me more than I usually let on. She's making a point of wasting her life. I've talked to her so many times about getting into hobbies, exercise, and new experiences. I'm losing interest, even though we get along well when we have time together.

He ended up prescribing me an anti-inflammatory drug. I got it filled out at the pharmacy and swallowed one.

It wasnt a particularly bad day. Just standard numbness and anxiety and lack of joy. But a couple hours later I had a big high. Like a veil had lifted and everything seemed clearer, I felt social and talkative, I felt the air rush my lungs as I took a deep breath. Everything felt lovely and exhilarating. That kind of bizarre mood that hits once every three months and makes you wonder how you could ever have been depressed.

So naturally I suspected the antiinflammatory I took. Going through a particularly bad night it always felt like there was a tangible pain in my head, not pounding but just *there*, nearly weightless but heavy enough to be known, like sadness had a weight. Maybe thats inflammation?

137,"My boyfriend, who has depression, keeps trying to make me break up with him. [x-post r/relationships]Hi, all. I'm looking for some insight and would appreciate any advice I can get. I apologize in advance if any of my terminology is incorrect or offensive.

**Background:** I've [24F] been seeing my boyfriend [24M] for about eight months now, exclusively for six or so. We've both graduate students living about four hours apart (seeing each other for ~3 days every other week or so under normal circumstances), though we also dated in undergrad five years back and have known each other for six years. I'm moving to his city after I graduate. I've been in the Middle East for 2.5 months doing health research with refugees, so we've been longer-distance than usual; I'll be back home in 20 days. He has a history of depression and has been on SSRIs for almost two years now, I think. I had three major depressive episodes from ages 13-20 or so but think I'm in the clear now; I've hoped this has made me a bit more understanding and empathetic than the average human would be, but maybe it's been too long and I don't understand what it's like anymore, I don't know.

**When I was nearby** he hadn't felt down for more than half a day or so at a time. I intellectually knew he's struggled with depression, but aside from talking about how to deal with it, it never really impacted me. 

**Since I've been abroad** he's had 3 or so periods of ""not having feelings"" lasting 1-2 weeks at a time. The previous one - about a month ago - culminated in me insisting that he go to the doctor (who upped his SSRI dose by 50 mg) and begin seeing a counselor (his second session is coming up this Tuesday). I insisted that we would ride these periods out together, that I am totally okay if he isn't the best partner for a while, that I'm here to listen and that periods of numbness don't scare me because I've been there and I know they end. I thought we made a ton of progress and that things would be okay until I got back. This is really, really fucking rough on me - obviously nobody likes to hear things like ""I can't have feelings"" from someone who is supposed to be kind and supportive - but I think I've done a pretty good job of not letting it get to me and riding these times out.

Normal Boyfriend is the fucking best thing ever. I think my life would be pretty okay if I married this guy. We're not in love yet but we want the same things in life, he's pretty much everything I've wanted in a partner, he's told me I'm as close as he'll ever come to his ideal woman, blah blah blah.

Depressed Boyfriend makes me feel...nothing in particular. It's like a gap in our relationship when I do my own thing and wait for him to come back out. It's better than being single because I know we can ride this out and that it will end. This is not that hard because I am okay being single, and also I'm halfway across the world mired in poverty and conflict so my problems don't seem that bad, and also because I know he will come back eventually (if not before I leave, then when I get back). It's not great, obviously, but it's something I can persist through. I get more worried about him persisting through them, though, while I'm gone.

He entered another major downturn a few days ago and I don't know if he broke up with me (out of nowhere, over text, while drinking) last night or not. Probably he did, but I am nearly 100% certain this is a self-destructive thing Depressed Boyfriend is doing that I need to help him realize makes no sense &amp; push through. Some sample things he's said:

- ""You keep assuming [Normal Boyfriend] is out there somewhere. I don't know that that's true""
- ""I think you should let me go. I am not work the fight or the struggle.""
- ""I just think I am broken and done""
- ""There is something in me that is broken and consequentially doesn't give me feelings""
- ""I am the one who is at best making this relationship really hard and at worse actively torpedoing it by being dysfunctional""

So, r/depression, any insight? Is this a thing I push through or fight against? I really like this guy and want to stay with him. I'm secure in my worth as a partner, not codependent, and not bothered by numb periods. I also know that he's historically been fine when we are in a normal state of affairs i.e. able to actually see each other.

When I started to going to highschool something changed, I used to spent LOT of time on internet, playing games, listening to music (god i digged through every kind of genre I almost have nothing to listen to). I had brighten senses I felt music so much than the others I loved people more than they loved me. Second grade of highschool I've been watching movies, going out getting high and then home listening to music and watching movies, i used to be all night awake

but you know, I felt kinda ill, i wasnt able to have serious releationship cause i was seriously addicted to feel smth, like, i was listening to music 15h a day sometimes one song over over and over again. So i went to psychoterapetuist, said her few things (I never had suicidal thoughts, I was happy, melancholic) and she suspect I've veen depressed for a long time and gave me Asentra (I am on 150mg once a day) and something to focus better.

My life hasnt been any good since that. I TRULY miss my old myself. Now i feel normal, primitive, mediocre. I started drinking to feel more like myself, I am tired all the time even i sleep a lot.

141,"Ways to save on medications if you don’t have insurance.***I’m not being promoted by any of these companies. I work as a pharmacy tech and simply want to help people save some money and show them ways to do so.

***Any discount cards/programs can and often do change their prices. It is not uncommon for prices to fluctuate throughout the year.


Sometimes pharmacies (especially retail pharmacies) have savings programs. Walgreens has a [Prescription Savings Club](https://www.walgreens.com/topic/psc/psc_terms_conditions_page.jsp). It’s $20/year for an individual and $35/year for a family (I think you can have 4 people on it). It saves money on a lot of medications. If you don’t save the amount that you pay per year, you will get the money reimbursed to you on a gift card after one year.

There’s a discount program called [Family Wize](famiywize.org) that often provides discounts on medications.

There’s an amazing website &amp; app called [Good Rx](goodrx.com). You type in your medication (dosage, amount) and it pulls up the discounts cards that will save you the most money. It also separates it by pharmacy so you’re able to shop around for the cheapest price.

I’ve heard very good things about [Single Card](singlecare.com). It works similarly to Family Wize.

Doctor’s may have discount cards for brand-name medication. This is usually used along with insurance but there are some that can help save money without insurance. If you use brand name medication (not generic) it may be worth asking about.

Many pharmacies will work with you to help find discounts. Don’t be afraid to ask!

If anyone has any other discount programs, feel free to share in the comments!

I'm 26. I tried to go to college for journalism from 2009-2013. I failed out my last semester and didn't come back until I went online-only in 2015. I was kicked out again because I failed all my classes due to nonattendance. Basically, college and I don't get along. I really want it to, but I lack any motivation and when I miss an assignment, a snowball effect happens to the point where I will ignore future assignments and emails from the university.

I make 11 dollars an hour in a shitty job while acquaintances all around me are buying houses, settling into lucrative careers and figuring shit out. All of my  coworkers are using the current job we have as a stepping stone to greater things, while I am stuck on autopilot doing front desk work for a hotel. 

I'm married to a really amazing guy who loves me very much, but I can't seem to wrap my head around the fact that someone gives enough of a shit to put up with my shitty job where I work every weekend and am too tired, lazy or sad to go to the local dollar theater or go outside for a run.

I want to be medicated but I also have intense anxiety and the idea of going online or calling up local therapists for assistance is very scary. I have prehypertension that gets worse in times of stress, so I freak out at the idea of going to any medical facility because they will inevitably take my blood pressure and tell me that I need to get it under control. It's under control for the most part but when I get anxious it shoots up.

I'm depressed through all of this because it feels like I'm on a constant treadmill. I want to escape my stupid job and instead work a normal salaried 9-5 like my friends who don't have to worry about bills. I want to be able to be happy when I occasionally hang out with them, but I constantly find myself comparing myself to others. 

For example, I went to a birthday dinner with a friend and everyone at the table was making small talk and asking what they do for a living.

My home life has sucked beyond repair. It has gotten to the point where I asked the boyfriend to leave. He refused even though he never signed the lease with the landlord and my name is on all the utilities. He just got back from deployment and promised me he'd start looking for jobs in January after taking the holidays off, which was no biggie to me. January, February, March, and April have all passed with him not even trying to find a job. His truck broke down from disuse in that time as well. I am/was the grocery shopper, the cleaner, took care of the cat, cooked, and did the laundry. All the while he was playing video games for 48 hours at a time. I ask for normal relationship things in return with no effort on his part.

We've fought so much about him being a better partner and doing and sharing in some of the the things I like. He changes for a day and then it is back to square one. We have a dead bedroom. After being on deployment you'd think he'd have pent up sexual needs? No, in the six months he's been back, we've only had about 5 sexual encounters. Right now it's been once since mid December. I know that's partially my fault because I don't initiate, but I admit my self confidence is in the tubes and when I did try to initiate, he wanted to play video games instead. 

Home life isn't all of it, my social group has moved away and I feel like I have zero people to talk to. All I have is my sister, and granted she doesn't want to hear about my dead bedroom. I would love to go out and meet new people and go on adventures, but the bf abhors public places. We've been out once since January.

Then there is generic work crap. Usually I can handle it, but this past week has been so overwhelming that I'm crying at work and when I get home. I miss being artistic, I was trained in theatrical stage management but can't make a living off of it in a medium Midwest city, and hate the idea of moving to Chicago or New York to work three jobs to make ends meet.

So I just feel at the absolute end of my rope. I called off work today because I couldn't handle another day of soul sucking stress.

I don't even want this to be a cry form help because I don't want to spend the money on yet another hospitalization. I just want to know I'm being heard.

146,"I cannot see a way out of this....I just need to vent. And I think that writing this with the hope of some one seeing this is the best way at the moment.  I have never written anything like this before, but my reasoning behind this post may be for cathartic benefit for myself, or a cry for help.  

I have suffered from severe anxiety and depression since the age of 16 (I am currently 26).  I have not been on meds for a few years (prozac, citalipram, diazapam, propananol etc).  However, due to the fact that I know at times I have moments of clarity, and can feel relatively ok at times, compounded with an increase of desire to self harm 'just to feel something' (cliched I know), I decided to try and cope on my own without such means. 

Presently, I am in a stage of my life where I can not cope with the overwhelming sense of dread, doom and self loathing.  I try to blame things on my situation.  I don't want to go too deep in to a back story about my past, but presently I have just graduated with an MA, but am unemployed and desperate.  Yet I do not think I could hold down a job at the moment.  I'm just so tired.  I am barely getting by on benefits, and all I want is to sleep and cry. and cry. and sleep.  And yet sometimes I favour the depression because at least I can breathe; with the anxiety I can't.

I just feel hopeless... I have spent 6 years of my life at uni to try and do something in order to help people.  But I can't even help myself to get out of bed... shower... get dressed...  I find no joy in anything anymore... apart from music... but I make myself cry when I play guitar...

AH well that was a depressing rant to myself... probably why I posted to r/depression!

tldr; used to do a hobby, then slowly stopped doing it. Now going back to do it feels like my brain is rejecting the idea even if I wanted to

Ok so story time, before I was studying college for Finance I tried learning how to do 3D animation on my own for fun. I was only using pre-made 3D characters and don't make my own because I have zero knowledge to 3D animation. I loved making my own animations and did it for 2-3 years though I didn't do it full time, just every now and then. I then kind of considered actually learning the full aspects of 3D animation so I tried to learn how to draw so I can make my own models but the progress was very slow due to lack of time. I was enjoying it so much that I'm partly neglecting my studies. Another part that is preventing me from fully learning the art of animation is I only have a hand-me-down laptop that barely runs the program. Still with great will power I made some animations that I uploaded on deviantart and nico seiga(Japanese image collection site, it's like youtube but also has image hosting). I tried making a project that was more than I was capable of. The progress was incredibly slow and frustrating due to lack of equipment. When I was nearly graduating, the project just stopped progressing. I was running out of ideas on what should I do next. Then I graduated and I just stopped doing those things.

Even after all those things, when I started looking for my first job as a fresh grad, I just can't still keep it out of my mind. I swore to myself that I'll get back doing it and buy a new PC to handle it. I got my first job with decent pay after some months, 3-4 months after graduation I think. But it wasn't easy to save up for the PC. I had to give most of my income to my parents to help them with their debt and fought with them at times because of that. I made a gamble to myself that by a certain time I still wasn't able to buy that PC I'll just stop that hobby entirely. And so it did reached to the point that I wasn't still able to buy it. Looking back, it was painful to see my old works, wondering how I was able to do them or what I thought and felt back then. So I closed my deviantart page. My only backup was the motion files but all the rendered animations are gone for good, at least most of it. Some are still around the net. I just simply thought the hobby is not for me. I just focused on work and lived like an average person. Then just this few months ago, not long after I closed my deviantart page, I was able to save up and by my own PC! It was 50x better than my laptop. It was crazy that I thought I won't have it due to life issues. I just started thinking of doing my old hobby again. I mean, it's pretty much the reason I was working to buy this stupid PC. But for some reason, regardless if now I have the resources and time, my body just keeps rejecting of me doing it. I mean even drawing just needs paper, pencil and eraser. I opened the animation program but whenever I try to do something with those, like when I try to make the character move, or with the drawing tools I try to draw something, my body just freeze. I have the idea in my head already, almost like how it did years ago. But I just seem to stop moving. Then my head will try to distract me to do something else like games or T.V.

I've put up with the vicious cycle of ""wanting to do it but couldn't"" for a long while now (I think around May). I don't know what is my condition is called. Depression? Anxiety? What is it? To people I know, the whole thing, buying PC and learning 3D non-professionally, is very stupid but I know it's fun and that's all that matters but I just can't get back to it and it's driving me crazy!",depression,depression,0.75
149,"SO battling a complete meltdown overseas... How can I help?A recap of the situation: his father is dying, and he is leaving my hubs a business that is time-consuming and completely new to him, which will now hinder him building his own career back here in the states. The business is essentially a good form of income to help support his sister, who is on disability from the government. His sister is a sociopath with cancer who has abused my hubs in every which way for years and years, who is beyond selfish and lies consistently. So called ""friends"" are circling like vultures as his dad is passing away, hoping to receive something (his father specifically said they are all thieves). And my hubs is there, by himself in this mess, surrounded by people who do not care nor support him. He has such a massive weight on his shoulders, and all he wanted was a few quiet moments to spend with his father during his last days, but he cannot achieve this. 

I spoke to him tonight via skype. He looks like a zombie, and he said he feels like hes going crazy. He says he has all these negative, awful thoughts in his head, terrible terrible ones, and keeps saying that he wants to wake up from this nightmare. That he (keep in mind, strict ""logical atheist"") needs God, he needs a miracle. He can't seem to focus, to be his usual, strict, sensible, no-nonsense self and all these people there surrounding him are just god-awful, ill-willed people. He keeps breaking down, and he has no idea when he's coming home, and I do not think he has a plan set up, or that the plan keeps getting re-written depending on how his sister is treating him.

I can't stand the thought that he is breaking down like this overseas and it kills me to see him like this. I have reassured him its okay to cry, its normal to break down, its fine, ""im so sorrys"" and sending him pictures of my friends dog (who he loves). After tonight though, I tried a different approach. I told him to create his own miracle, to dig down within him self and put on a shield to avoid being hurt by these people. To spend the time that he is crying and shutting down differently, and exert his energy towards getting shit done that needs to be done and GTFOing from that place and those people. I tried the tough, motivation-geared approach and I hope this way helps.

To be honest, seeing him like this scares me to death. I don't want his health to fail from all this stress and pressure, I don't want him to completely lose his sanity and himself in this, I don't want him to be reeling in pain. I told him to hold it all in and then grieve when hes back here, with people that care and love him. I don't know if he can do it though... The look on his face tonight was one I have never seen before, and it turned my stomach inside out. I felt sick. I've never seen him look so...so...destroyed. It scares me.

I don't know what to do. Its all I think about... at home, at work, driving... its affecting my performance at work and my numbers have dropped drastically (in sales). My boss is worried about me. My family and coworkers are concerned. But its like, when someone you love is being destroyed and they are so far away, I can't concentrate on anything except the aching in my heart. 

I don't know what to do, how to help. I feel awful for him...

Everyone here on Long Island is all about how beautiful of a day it is and I went out to do some errands with my roommate who's a single guy and was commenting on any pretty girls we happened to run into and all I can think is, who cares.

153,"Figured out why im severely depressed and will probably kill myself in a few years. M/22Somewhat rantish and this isn't the full story as i don't really want to talk about it too much

I was a fat child growing up and both my parents were fit and athletic for the most part. I've struggled a lot with my weight and the only thing my mother would do to help me was get frustrated that i didn't fit into clothes.

those actions have reduced me to tears as a child and weighed heavily on my mind and has severely destroyed any self confidence i've ever had years ago.

My dad is what i would call ""an absolute fuckwit"" his abuse over the years also destroyed all self confidence.

I've found that these two factors combined are the primary reason for my severe depression. Growing up with no self confidence at all.

as you can imagine i have had no success with girls at all, absolutely nothing, not a date, not a kiss. to my knowledge a girl has never liked me. 

Being a male as well in today's modern generation of relatively easy no strings sex you can imagine that it weighs ver heavily on my mind just how much of a failure i am. Plus im just straight out ugly as well.

I've been able to achieve things, i made it through the navy and made great friends there, but still in my mind i am a complete and utter failure and i just cannot bring myself to believe anything other than that.

I've lost 10kg's and have another 10 to go but honestly i doubt it will make much of a difference to my mental well being.

I do have an opportunity though for the end of this year to secretly leave and change my identity and leave everyone and everything behind, which i will be following through with as i believe the only thing that could change my life is if i leave and forget my past and try and start a new life.

154,"Questioning the ""other"" self.Failed a basic competency assessment at a job I interviewed for recently and it's hit me really hard. It prompted me to figure a few things out about myself, and I'm looking for some input. 

I'm in my mid forties, and have managed to keep depression mostly at bay with exercise and playing music. Tried therapy and drugs decades ago. Utter bullshit for me.

One constant has been an inner duality; a version of myself inside myself that both is and isn't me. (shit this is hard to articulate)

I can't identify or ""see"" him, but he reveals himself in all my shame and failures. Not sure, but maybe I fabricated this abstraction to deflect accountability for my flaws and misdeeds? If I do something I'm ashamed of, *he* did it. Failed at something in the past? It was him. Weakness? Procrastination? Yep, him again.

Positive achievements and enjoyment doesn't hurt him, but he doesn't get the credit for them. I do it to spite him. In fact, I get great satisfaction out of showing him I'm not his bitch by getting up early, working hard, being magnanimous, just generally doing the right an proper thing. Like he gives me a shitty smirk and crosses his arms and waits for an opening to fuck me up.

But this recent failure made me question him. Is he holding me back? My feelings for him lay somewhere beyond hatred. It's not that he's evil and I hate him. He's me, so how would that work? I'm getting to this point in my life, mid-life crisis or whatever, where I realize how much time and opportunity was squandered. I want to get all I can out of what life is left. Is this duality holding me back? 

If I were to kill him, would I be able to shoulder the burden of my failures and flaws? Would I really be in control? Wouldn't I just manufacture some other excuse when I'm tired or bored? 

Or do I embrace him, and hold him so closely and tightly that he's forced to abide by my will? Same thing as killing him I guess, but maybe I need him close to me. Maybe I *can't* kill him. I mean, what would I do to kill him anyway?

I can't tell if this makes any sense to anyone or not, which is why I'm posting this and hoping maybe someone has a word or two to help untangle this.

My last year on high school, i thought that was going to kick some asses with my friend, be the cool guys that i used to see when i was on the elementary.

Well, i never touched a girl. Every motherfucking time i was thrown on the Friendzone. I had a short online relationship with a girl, and when i was making plans on visit her, she ended with me 5 days after we begin.

That make me kick the tables. I was the tipical nerd guy. I am kinda fat, w/ 110kg and 1,84m, and have a hormonal dysfunction that keeps me kinda fat, even by the fact that i don't like fast foods, candy and that crap, and making exercises. I don't care about being a fat guy, aesthetically talking.

I started to use ear stretchers, changed my haircut and attitude. Started to be more like the ""bad guy"". But there were some monsters inside of me that kept eating me from inside. I was the bad, and cool guy on front of the guys on classes, but when got home, sit down on my room for hours crying.

My relationship with my parents is very weak. My father don't talk to me for days, even he being at home every day. My mother tries to be the cool mother, and really do alot of stuffs to me. I was the expected son, 1/10000 chances to born, but now, everyone don't care at all. When everyone on my family is angry, stressed or shit, they found on me a good spot to discharge the angry. And with that i heard a lot of stuff that made me want to kill myself.

I have some friends. My best friend is my former math teacher, who saw in me a ""young version"" of him. The other one is a friend of over 10 years of friendship, that i consider as a brother. I talk with them about all this stuff, they give me some councils, but i feel like that are just words.

I thought alot of times on suicide. One time i was with my friend at a spot next to the ocean, on a 10m high and just thought what would happen if i jump. I'm a atheist, so it would just end my troubles. There is no afterlife, so fuck what the others would pass through. But yet, i did nothing.

I have a bad historic of atempts on relationships. The first girl i gave my heart didnt like boys. Two years with alot of alcohol trying to forget her, i met the girl of my dreams. The only girl in real life that got my jokes. She is Redditor, gamer, comic fan just like me. But even that i tried so hard, she don't give me a chance. Says that don't believe in love, and want to be alone forever.

(medical question)Is it true that a doctor might write you a script, and you might fill it out at the pharmacy, and the label might say ""prozac"" or whatever, but actually the doctor wrote a secret code to the pharmacist that you will never see, even if you ask, to give you a placebo pill instead? And that the only way to find out if this happened to you is to test the pills themselves?

I've been to the doctor time and time again for mental health issues. Maybe she did put such a note on the script believing that I'm a hypochondriac now? 

Is it true that doctors might write secret codes to each other on you records, saying ""sugar pills only"" basically, ensuring that you never get on real anti-depressants even if you change doctors, once they get your permanent records?

It should not be possible to feel this bad while taking my meds every day. It should not. This is the third time I've crashed while being 100% compliant. The first two times I assumed the pills had been tampered with. I've been on every class of drugs there is, er, allegedly, at least that's what my records say, the parts that are available to me. I exercise and eat healthy and go to work every weekday. I also sob and shake uncontrollably for 12-20 hours a week, or more if something bad happens, and have no energy or patience. No problem, except that nobody wants to be around me anymore and it's impossible to get anyone to take me seriously or interact with me pleasantly under the circumstances.

So is it true? Have I been taking sugar pills all this time? I'd go back to the doctor and have her look me in the eye and demand the truth, but you know, that would seem crazy, and after all, the whole point of secrets is not to tell them, so of course any health professional would lie about this, and keep lying, and here I am I can't tell the difference because my brain is broken.

When I didn't keep track of these things I'd stay up for days, without thirst or hunger, holding in everything to not have to use the restroom, and wearing dirty clothes. After having left my home after weeks, I came back recognizing the stench I lived in obliviously. That's when i decided I have to organize living though I never heard of this before. It's easy to live this way. I didn't used to be so bad and I was successful in a social career. I gained savings and have been living off this for 9 months. The home I live in is owned by my father who uses his retirement to pay the bills. I feel like a failure. I'm not an adult, I am an infant. My body is growing wider and unhealthy. Why does my brain betray me, giving me this feeling of being inhuman and broken. Where do I reach inside to switch from survive to live and be free?",depression,depression,0.90

I am still showering and brushing my teeth daily, well brushing twice daily. This morning I gave my wife a kiss while she was asleep. This is the first time I have done this in years. I went 3 days without taking the klonopin and felt the same, the klonopin in my opinion is not masking any of my feelings, it is just helping with my anxiety. I am liking work more and more and not letting people get to me as much. I have been stretching and meditating daily, which feels great. I am strong and I will not fail!

The downside, I am not sleeping as well and was prescribed gabapentin for this.
My wife says I look majorly drugged.

It disgusts me! I HATE it! It ruins any day or moment for me. Suicide is not a fucking joke. It's very serious. I just get so mad and depressed when people say shit like that. It's like they're making fun of it, which is truly just disgusting. But it also feels like everyone who actually feels that way and everyone who has attempted...they're feelings are just insignificant and ridiculous. There is nothing more insulting.

176,"Hopefully Y'all Can Provide Some WordsWell, okay. I guess I broke up with my then girlfriend about a month ago. It still hurts a lot. I know I am the one who broke up with her but ever since then, I've just felt like it was a mistake and I can't figure out why. I made the choice to breakup with her based on a number of emotions I was having about the relationship including non-fulfillment, getting angry often with her (probably dealing with my unhappiness in the relationship), and just general unhappiness. With those thoughts in mind, I broke up with her but as soon as I did, I had these rush of emotions that I was absolutely wrong and wanted her back. I tried to get her back but it didn't/hasn't worked as she moved on pretty quickly with other guys, which of course infuriates the fuck out of me because I haven't even felt like sleeping or hooking up with anyone. 

I hate to complain about something so tripe but it still hurts everyday. For instance, today I saw her walking and she looked pretty wonderful and I just went into the bathroom and cried. It was ridiculous, I just had this flow of overwhelming emotions about her. I'm just not even sure if it's her I miss or whether or not it's just that I'm now very lonely currently since the breakup. I'm sure it's a both honestly. 

I'm not entirely sure what I expect as advice, maybe prior experience? I mean, I have the idea in my head that yeah eventually I'll find someone else but it doesn't make the pain any less and also makes being social really difficult as I don't even want to sleep with anyone. What I really want is intimacy not just sex. Random hookups seem purely physical and I don't want that. I was comfort, trust, and intimacy. Anyway, yeah, I'm not sure what I expect advice-wise but it would be nice to hear other people about this. ",depression,teenager,0.75
177,"Opening upEver since I found this subreddit I check in on it daily. There's something about the stories and experiences people write about. I couldn't figure it out at first, but the more and more I read, the more I realized that I experience those things and feel the same ways daily. I'm 14, and first year of high schools been like shit. Since the year started, I feel like I'm a hollow shell  of myself, not caring about the things I used to and the only emotions a feel are sadness and anger. My grades have always been pretty good and still are, but now in my head I keep telling myself it's pointless. Why do I keep trying and putting up with it if I still feel like shit even after I know I did well. Also, I've never been the best at making friends and meeting new people, so transitioning to a new school has affected me quite a bit. Every day I feel lonely. No ones goes out of their way to talk to me but other people's lives seem to be going on just fine. This is when I started to think about stuff... not suicide I would never do that to myself, but just how much easier it would be if I didn't exist, If I was a different person.

I guess what this post is really about is that I haven't really told anyone about the way I'm feeling and the thoughts going on inside my head. I'm scared to. I don't know if I actually have a problem or that I'm just overreacting and getting over-emotional for no reason. I'm scared to tell someone about it because of the possibility of me being ridiculed. What if it actually is just in my head. I put on a fake smile everyday and pretend like nothing's wrong, but truthfully I  even know who I am anymore.

The problem is I want to tell someone, but just as I'm about to I stop myself because of that fear. I don't want it to keep going on like this but I don't know how to talk about it, how to open up. That's why I'm posting this, because I truly have no idea how to do it. I know that if I do, things could get better and that's what I want, but I won't let myself because of that chance of failure. What should I do?",depression,teenager,0.75
178,"I need help with my depressive girlfriend!First of all: Sorry for any grammar mistakes or anything, English is not my mother tongue!

Hello Redditors, 

I really need your help and any tip is highly appreciated! I've been in a relationship for a month now with a wonderful girl, but she is depressive, got PTSD, has a social phobia, got ADHD and epilepsy.

I really love her, but I am afraid I'll lose her because of all her, let's call it ""problems"".

To give you a better idea of everything I'll give you some brief information about myself first: My name is Rene, I am 20 years old and from Germany. I am a drummer and a pianist and like hitting the gym on a regular basis. I'm already living alone with my dog, have a nice job and earn a good amount of money. I gotta admit, however, that I'm not sane mentally either. I have some problems too which is why I have an appointment at a psychologist soon too. One important information: My ex girlfriend cheated on me too which is why I have trust issues!

Now let's get to my girlfriend: She is 18 years old and she means the world to me. She is very unsatisfied with herself and says she is fat, which she really isn't. I wouldn't even call it chubby! She is feeling really bad currently and I don't know how to help her or how to react in certain situations. She's not able to work due to her depression and I am really afraid of losing her. She is really jealous too and has problems with me writing with female friends I know for really long, even though she met most of them already and knows I would never cheat on her. She, however, writes with some other guys I don't know and doesn't see a problem with it. However, this is a problem to me, as she is really ""declining"" recently. We made plans when to see each other and sometimes she just says she wants to be alone right before I go to pick her up and we don't see each other, and this has happened a few times now. Yesterday, when she was with me, she said she didnt feel too good and wanted to go home. I show her how much I love her every day, and I really try so hard to show her that she means the world to me by surprising her with gifts and everything, but she does not seem to see what I do for her and doesn't really appreciate what I do for her. Due to my trust issues and the distance that is between us (40 Kilometres/25 Miles) I am really afraid of losing her to another guy because she doesn't often reply to a text from me and doesn't message me when I don't write her first. It just feels like she wouldn't care and it's tearing me apart inside because I am really unsatisfied with myself even though everyone says I should be proud of myself for what I do and stuff, but as above mentioned, I have some problems myself and go to see a psychologist.

Anyway, I just want to understand and help her with the depression but don't know how to anymore. I can't visit her at her home because she got a cat which I am allergic to. She declining me hurts me every time and I am afraid that I can't continue this relationship because her ""problems"" might jump over to me as well, at least that's how I start to feel. When she is with me we are having nice time together, laugh a lot, and except for the depression it really is a wonderful relationship and I am not someone who gives up too early. I usually fight a lot for what I want, and I really don't want to lose her. I thought writing this in this subreddit might be the best because you can understand her point of view, which I am obviously not able to. Is the declining thing something related to her depression? I am quite sure she loves me, but it feels like she doesn't because she doesn't show it to me.

Thank you for reading the long text, I really appreciate any help. 

Best regards from Germany!
Rene

179,"A seventeen year old boy whose depression has been topped-up by a girl, how cliche. If you read this, thank you for allowing me to waste some of your day with my pathetic sadness.Such a deep title, ha.. I personally didn't think *Girlfriend trouble pt. 2* or *Seventeen year old with depression* had the same effect. Those two pretty much sum it up though, three months ago I was... Coping? I was doing very well, in fact. I had purpose, I had goals, and I looked forward to my life. Now it's just like... How about I go hang myself in a fucking forest and wait for someone to come find me and the note that says *""I just couldn't live without her""*.

**Part 1 summarised:** I posted here before. My girlfriend broke up with me. I fought for two weeks to get her back, but she blocked me on several accounts. It's a long-distance relationship you see, or was... I fell in love on February 17th 2014 as a 16 year old, how cliche. That's not important, well.. It is.. But you believing that isn't. What's important is that she's gone now and she took everything of mine with her. My emotion, my trust, my enthusiasm, my determination, everything. After 2 or 3 weeks of fighting and 2 days after she blocked me (3 Skype accounts and a Facebook), she returned (She did also state months prior that she would have wanted me to chase her if she did in fact leave, as it shows I care). After 3 weeks of being broken up and 2 days of being entirely blocked she unblocked me and said hello.

That was this Sunday. Just two days earlier she'd told me she didn't want anything to do with me and wasn't in love with me anymore. All the promises, plans and emotion we once shared was now meaningless. But, she came back as she wondered how I was. However, somehow that didn't go too well as I didn't understand how 3 weeks of avoiding me would lead to her caring. She went to sleep as she thought I had ""Argued"" with her for coming back... *How was I too know... Of course I was distrusting  and questioning of what was going on...*

A similar thing happened the next day as I wanted to remain distant and see if she **wanted** to talk to me. Well, fast forward to today, 3ish days later and she told me I'd blown my ""Chance"" without even realising. I hadn't been told it was a chance and was only left to assume. I assumed that it was her checking on me to see i hadn't killed myself. Perhaps I was correct. But she perceived it as me arguing and disputing her return...

What a fucking idiot I was. That was my 1 chance I'd fought for, for 3 fucking weeks.

She told me she'd been asked out on a date today, to a museum by another boy. She had accepted. I have to say, I started physically shaking when she told me, not 30 minutes before I had to work. My legs went numb and I don't know what the cause was. Not anger, not sadness, not frustration, just self loathing, perhaps?

I fucking hate myself. I let her leave and without even knowing this time. She came back of her own accord and I didn't even realise. I kept thinking back to how I stayed distant, why did I do that? When I think back to how I acted, my plan of letting her show emotion first, I feel physically sick. My legs shake and my body hurts in its entirety.

It's not heartbreak, it's a top-up of my recurring depression. It was fine when I had her around. She was literally my emotional rock and anchor. Now, she's gone.

My tutors at college hate me.

I have 1 friend.

I have a shitty job.

My plans, goals and dreams have been smashed in front of me.

My alcoholic parents are getting divorced.

I really don't have any ambition now, it all involved her. I don't know why I've written this down. I could've easily just put this in my 20 page diary I have for how I feel about her. But I thought I'd put it here, to see if some people can relate, maybe?

I don't need sympathy. I don't need love. I don't need care. Maybe I need time? I posted this last time and no one really read it, maybe this time someone will see. Maybe not? Maybe that just sums up my entire life so far. Lots of maybes and no results.

Thank you for reading, I really appreciate it. I don't know what this achieved. I don't feel fulfilled, I feel like a stupid boy who is seeking attention. But fuck it, I enjoy this community, it makes me feel less vulnerable, because we're sad together and that makes us stronger.",depression,depression,0.80

I have gone through a lot in my life, but I didn't come here to complain. I know everyone is going through their own hard times and I was hoping maybe I could get help here. I have had depression for a long time so I will just pick the place in my life when I first discovered it. I will try to not get into too much detail. When I was in, I believe 7th or 8th grade, some of my friends and teachers started noticing odd things about me. I was always tired, I stopped dressing the way I used to, I stopped wearing makeup, I stopped caring about my hair, the way I looked, the way I acted... I stopped caring about most things other than my school work. School was more like a home to me than my home was. I had amazing, supportive friends, all of the teachers in my school loved me, I had high grades... However, I got bullied a lot. I wouldn't say I got bullied more than some other kids in my school but I was pretty high up there. Not only was I bullied but a lot of my friends were bullied too.. I assume it was because of me because they never did anything to upset anyone and eventually they stopped being bullied and some started bullying... My at home life wasn't much better. My older brother made me feel like he hated me, my mom would always put me down and was always drinking and I never talked to my dad. After a while of this going on my friends discovered some cuts on me.. One of my friends an I had a private conversation about the suicidal thoughts I had been having. One day I walked into my favorite class, before I made it through the door my teacher turned me around back into the hallway. When class started she started talking to me, telling me how my friend came to her and told her what I had said, she said she would need me to go to the counselor and asked if I wanted to tell them or if I wanted her to. I had always been shy so I asked her to. After talking to the counselor for a while I was crying and they said I would need to tell my mom. I was afraid to tell her because I figured she would be mad at me for making her look like a bad parent. I was surprised to find out that wasn't true. When I called her she just asked why I said nothing. The school made her get me to a therapist, psychologist and take medications. Let's skip forward because the next few years were fine for me besides the previously mentioned, my grandpa died and a few other things that don't matter much. What matters was I managed to get through it with only a few scars on my body. When I was in 10th grade my mom told me we had to move out of our house because the people we rented from wanted to sell it. We ended up moving two hours north away from my already fading friends (7/8th grade I had many then I only had 4). AS soon as I moved all conversations with my friends stopped, no one at my school talked to me anymore, even my ""school friends"" (friends I only hang out with at school) stopped texting me and calling me. I was alone, my brother didn't live with us anymore because he had just turned 18 and all I had was my two cats. I didn't have a single friend left and my mom was never home. I was hours away from my ex friends and states away from my family. (who had stopped talking to me really a while ago, but after this hasn't talked to me since).... A little while after we moved in I came home one day to see my cat being taken away from me... I had been waking up at 4am to drive to school two hours away to go to a school where I had no friends and only a few ex friends who would say hi to me every now and then as I struggled to make new ones. (I forgot to mention that this was 11th grade now and I hadn't switched schools because I got every class I wanted including; AP chem, AP lit, honors calc, civics, and instead of electives I took extra classes). Right after I got home from school everyday it would be about 5:15. So I would have 15 minutes to get home, relax, get ready for work and drive to work. Then I would work the closing shift usually 9:30-10pm. I know it wasn't that late but when I got home every night I had a ton of homework and was exhausted. So the homework piled up, I was all alone, I couldn't stay after school for help anymore, I couldn't pay attention in class, I started being late to school, and my life was hitting rock bottom. The only thing I had was my boyfriend who I had met that May. He lived 3 hours away from me so I would go stay with him on the weekends (I was 16 but my mom was never home and I was lonely). He supported me as much as he could through this... But he couldn't prepare me for what was to happened next.... I got a phone call one weekend night when I was at his house trying to do some homework that was way passed late. It was my mom, she wanted me to drive her to the next state to go see our family... at 10pm... while she was drunk.... she wanted me to drive to her (3 hours away) to drive her all the way to our family (9 hours away) right after I got my license, in the middle of the night... I told her we could go in the morning if she felt like it when she wasn't drunk. We said our goodnights and I went back to my homework. I stayed up late that night so I slept in until like 10am the next day. I woke up to many missed calls, texts, voicemails... From family I haven't heard from since I was 8, to numbers I had never seen, to my dad and cousin.... It seemed like the world exploded and everyone needed to talk to me.. I called my dad first he told me what happened.... My mom decided to drive herself to see our family and halfway there got in an accident.... She was drunk and she hit into the back of someone's car and the woman driving it died... (This is on the internet and I am trying to not give away our identities because the court case hasn't happened yet and I don't want to make it any worse for us so please don't nose around on the internet searching for it.) She was taken to jail... I had no where to go, my dad and brother couldn't take me I couldn't afford the place we were living... So I packed my things and moved in with my boyfriend.... I had to quit my job and leave school and give up everything I worked so hard for.... I also had to stop going to therapy and there was no way I could afford antidepressants, doctors appointments or even food.... So me, my things and the cat that my brother left when he moved out moved into his small bedroom with his college friends and prayed that life would get better.... But it didn't.... My mom got out of jail in a couple of weeks but had to go stay somewhere for alcoholics. She got permission for me to move there too but couldn't understand that I had lived with an alcoholic my whole life and didn't want to live with more than I had to... So I stayed put.. Months passed by and they were threatening to kick us out of the house because we had a cat and that wasn't allowed... I couldn't get rid of him... It felt like it was all that was left in my life... We ended up having to leave a few months later... We moved into a small dirty apartment in the worst part of town because it was the cheapest place we could find. After 9 months of struggling to live in a small space with all of our belongings, I have gained weight (I was already overweight), started cutting again (a few months ago), Haven't been able to make a single friend in this new town, had to quit two different jobs, $20,000 in debt, never got to go back to school, my mom is still blaming me for the situation I am in, all my boyfriend and I do is fight, I cry every night, I feel like I have no one to talk to... Probably because I don't... There are months when we worry we can't pay rent or buy food... I still don't feel safe going outside alone because of all the murders,  rapists, drug dealers and much more... Every day it gets harder and harder... I am giving up more and more on trying to fix it.... The only good thing that has happened this entire time is that yesterday.... Yesterday I finally got my GED..... I missed two years of school because my mom took a year to sign over guardianship to my boyfriend.... and I finally got my GED.... Over a span of 4 years.... Only one thing stands out to me enough to be remembered as a good experience.... And I don't even feel happy about it.... The day before yesterday I got prescribed my antidepressants again...

189,"Struggling with ChristmasI made a post a few weeks ago about how I was in a psychiatric ward and how I had been diagnosed with depression caused by psychological trauma. I self harm and hear a mans voice in my head or a ""commandatory hallucination"" as the psychiatrist called it.

Anyway I was discharged about 2 weeks ago, I'm on 100mg of sertraline and I have diazapam to help dull the voice and calm urges to self harm.

Today has been so hard for me. He's in my head telling me I should harm today. It's all too much to bear, everything is building back up again. I can't talk to anyone about it. I think everyone thinks I'm on the mend. Maybe I thought I was too. I feel really bad again, like how I felt before I was admitted into hospital. I want to dissapear. I cried this morning at the sheer thought of sitting at a table with everyone smiling and laughing. I can't pretend I'm happy when I'm not. I was having dinner there and I felt paranoid and all I could hear was the voice sniggering at me. He's making me ill, but he's the only one who seems to be able to understand me. He gets why I don't want to see anyone.

I don't really know why I posted, I guess I just needed to post it somewhere instead of keeping it all locked away in my head.

190,"Love, Loss and Illness.Hi, I never really get to talk to people about how I really feel because I don't want it to colour an entire friendship and I don't think I know many people who would care enough in the first place. 

I have been told I suffer from depression and anxiety. The last few years of my life have been quite rough. I am now 20. I have severe scoliosis and kythosis, while in school I would every day get comments like ""hunchback of notre dame"" people would call me ""it"" rather than ""he"". I met and with months fell in love with a girl who after I confessed to started ignoring me while pretending to still be my friend. After about a year she started to actually be friendly with me but I was so broken from the way she treated me I found it hard to trust her or anyone again. 

after this my dad was diagnosed with cancer and was given half a year to live. During this time I was told I needed to have urgent back surgery to prevent myself from becoming disabled or potentially even dying. I left for the surgery and had no idea what to say to my dad, I knew I may never see him again but barely said a word. The surgery had two parts, one a week after the other. My dad died the day after my 2nd part. My first memory was waking up to my granddad telling me he was dead. 

After I recovered enough to go home I was looking forward to seeing a couple of my friends including the girl I had fallen in love with (Who had now come out as a lesbian). She chose to go do something else unimportant rather than see me and the other did not want to see me alone, I saw them about half a year after I came home once I was able to walk for myself. (they had initially promised to see me in hospital) This hurt a fair amount. 

After all that I became more and more unhappy and anxious, constantly apologising to friends for small things and giving gifts to try to make up for them. This was especially true for the girl I fell in love with. Within a couple years I completely pushed her away, pushed the self-destruct button on our friendship because I could not handle it anymore. This hurt my relations with all of her friends of course. During all this I had tried going to counselling which did not really help and I did not get any support from my family. My mum would just not understand and ask if it was her fault or tell me to explain exactly why I was depressed. My brother asked me ""Has your councillor told you that there is nothing wrong with you and that your just an idiot yet?""

Since then I have also had heart surgery which has pushed me even further from being able to connect with people because now I cant drink alcohol to force me to pretend to not be anxious. I am now at uni in a place far away from my few friends. I also still think about that girl on a regular basis even though we have not even seen each other by chance in over a year. I often think about suicide and i'm just not sure how to deal with all of this. More than anything I wanted to tell someone or some people this. I can feel quite alone sometimes, without anyone to tell about these things because no one I know has been through even half of this.

Even if it's not productive or may seem pointless to others, do you reeaallyy feel deeply?

I find that, even though I'm doing much better than I was even a few months ago, I still don't feel strongly about anything (negative or positive, emotions or activities).

For folks who are recovering or doing well with depression, does this come back with time?

I've always been depressed and anxious since my dad beat my mom up and seperated our family about 7 years ago. We went from being lower-middle to now lower class. I used to be an A student and slowly lost my appreciation for life dropped out when I was 18 and got my GED. I've been working at a grocery store part time for three years now and have my own car so I should be able to live in that for a while. My question for you is what the fucks next?

I also get that my mum is frustrated but I really wish she'd stop telling people that I refused all help and never tried because it's a complete lie.

200,"7 Listeners from 7 Cups of Tea Rejected Me.I tried to talk to them about my issues (not wanting to work, not having the motivation to do anything else, etc), and each of them rejected me in different ways. Two said they ""can't help me anymore"" when they weren't helping to begin with (they weren't empathizing, they weren't asking about my needs, they immediately switch topics with their ""think positive!"" tirades), two were online, but had to go before we even started because ""something"" came up, something clearly more important than helping me, and two very simply blocked me.

Do they understand the message they're conveying by doing this? ""You're very difficult."" ""You're not worth my time."" ""I don't want to help you, even though I'm on this site.""

Knowing that even ""trained"" listeners can reject me brings in a lot of despair. Am I broken for good?

Additionally, the whole site blocked me off from connecting with anyone with the following message:

*Uh oh! We were not able to complete your request.*

*Request failed. (Code 100-faea099157c93ee3b117e72fe9031142)*

So the entire site is basically rejecting me, too. The people who are supposed to help are labeling me ""beyond repair"".

203,"Many people hate to acknowledge how they make you feel, but boy do they love wanting you to acknowledge how you make them feel. The world doesn't care.People don't exactly care. Your conditions affect them, it doesn't matter if it isn't deliberate. Your simple depressive presence keeps the mood down.

You may have friends that will outright tell you some mean things, right to your face, but you aren't allowed to argue against it. You're negativity is too much to handle. Who cares if they play some role in your failing mental health? Matter of fact, don't even fucking mention it. Don't you ever dare make someone consider that they may, in fact, be an asshole.

Eventually people just get sick and tired of you, from what I've seen. They eventually stop caring, especially if you express a desire to kill yourself. You live in a world that calls you weak, an attention seeker who is too pussy to live. And if you aren't up for swallowing pills and switching and upping dosages and talking to someone in an uncomfortable room for the rest of your life? You just don't want to help yourself. Even if you have the medical records to prove you've tried these methods time and time again, to no avail...You clearly refuse to do anything about healing your own wounds.

You have many people who will exploit it somehow, reel you into something. If you refuse, you'll see their true nature. You may even have people who make light of your ""theatrics"", friends who express, even through silence, that they can't be bothered by how they make you feel. Some may even insult you. Your depressive mood needs to belittled because it makes them uncomfortable and you'd better not comment on how crestfallen this makes you.

You live in a world that would, knowing what trauma is, risk traumatizing you even more if it means there is some slither of chance you'll 'heal'.

A few days go by and she still haven't answered the form so she decided to do it today.

These last 5 months it got pretty bad, culminating in me trying to OD about 3 weeks ago. My girlfriend followed suit on Thursday, and it hasn't helped my mindset. She would've died, had I not realized what she did. I feel like shit constantly now, failing at suicide, feeling like I should've done more for her before she attempted, emptiness, and constant suicidal thoughts. I'm taking antidepressants, but they don't do anything for me. I'm probably going to try again, and succeed, before school ends.

I can’t kill myself right now though. My aunt just died and I don’t want to seem like I’m attention seeking or something if I’m not successful. I don’t really want to live anymore. I’m not interested in anything. I feel so empty. I don’t want to be a burden. I don’t want to feel pressured to see people. I want to be alone. I want to this emptiness to be everything.

228,"How to Stop ThisI can't stop wishing for the ability to die without much pain to my loved ones, planning out elaborately for a failsafe way even if I try to chicken out, seeing myself dying everywhere- train, buildings, cars, bridges. I visualize it so clearly over and over again. I also have a history of impulsive serious self harm without even making a conscious decision to do it. I just got out of a psychiatric inpatient facility for the ninth time. I realized the last time it is completely pointless- the doctors don't see you long enough to be willing to make necessary changes, and/or overmedicate, then the cycle continues after a little while on the outside. Going in just makes me feel worse while there and especially after getting out. I'm rationalizing things, I've done my research and I realize that my feeling like a burden and desperation put me at higher risk, as well as previous attempt and impulsive decision. I'm trying everything and things just keep getting worse. I'm scared and tired and these thoughts don't go away the next day, they just get worse over time.

I'm not even deciding to die right now, but I have a feeling I will soon due to some random impulse and don't even care. I have a great support system with a therapist and psychiatrists and friends and family. I care about them and continue living for them, but I'm tired of living for others, I want to live for myself. I can't find a reason why though, I hate life and have hated it for quite some time, and the future looks bleak. It's funny, I try to save others but I don't even want to save myself, except for a half assed post on reddit.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95
229,"I’m going to leave my house and family on the 20th of JuneIn early 2016 I started getting frustrated and mad at my friends. I started noticing all the flaws in them and how they obviously didn’t care about the friendship aspect. They only wanted to be friends to play video games and things in that style. They never cared about the actual person they were friends with. I was struggling emotionally back then but I never asked them for support because it was obvious that wasn’t going to work. Eventually I don’t know why but I started trolling them anonymously online. They didn’t recognize who it was at first but eventually one of them asked if it was me. I immediately felt guilty and tried to delete everything. When it happened I immediately snapped back to reality and realized how much I was hurting them. After that I called I sick from school for few days left until summer and shut all of them out from my life. 

I have no idea why any of this happened. It might have been puberty, Aspergers or as I’ve recently been considering a hypomanic episode. After this happened for the next 3 years I’ve been completely isolated and haven’t had any meaningful social interaction with anyone except my family. I’ve tried finding friends in 3 different schools now along with other places but it has never worked. 

After the summer ended I started in my second school. After being basically isolated for the entire summer I had developed social anxiety and got a panic attack while entering the classroom. Because of this I was forced to work alone in another room. In this room I got almost nothing done and I constantly watched YouTube on my phone as escapism. I stayed in the room during breaks and therefore didn’t meet anyone. After being in this school for a year I switched to another school where people were given more support. Actual work went okay for the most part but almost everyone else in the school were unbearable. They were extremely socially awkward and constantly made me uncomfortable so after a year and a half I switched school once again. 

During all of this time I constantly longed someone to vent to but it just never happened. The majority of my awake time was spent with escapism. 

In early 2019 I started in my fourth school. A normal state run were people weren’t socially awkward. I also weren’t socially anxious anymore so everything was pointing towards things getting better but they never did. Work itself is okay so I might be able to get a good job but I’m extremely lonely and down. Later a day before my birthday in June I decided to write down all my thoughts in Notes in my phone as I didn’t have anyone I could vent to. I kept writing for almost 2 hours without realizing how much time was passing. When I was done I felt happier than I’ve felt in years and like I just drank an energy drink. While typing I realized that the only one that can make a difference in my life is me. Everything that happens in the world happens as an indirect consequence of what I do and don’t do. If I want to stop being lonely I’m the one who can fix that nothing and no one else. I also realized that everything is okay as long as no one gets hurt by it. This made me accept a lot of things I’ve been ashamed of. I also found out about the Venus Project which gave me a goal in life. It’s very hard to explain what it is so just go to www.thevenusproject.com if you want to find out. I felt amazing for a week and a half. After that I just felt numb as usual. At this point I figured out I might have a form of bipolar, probably cyclothymia. But there are still contradictions. I’ve still figured out the key to solving every problem in the world so I should be happy but I’m just not. This might be a sign I’m faking it all to give myself some feeling of control. Being bipolar isn’t fun but it would be nice to know what caused my life to suck so much. So since I still believe what I figured out while I was “hypomanic” I might have been faking the whole thing. I know that this is aparently this is a common thing to think when paranoid from bipolar subs but I’m not going to let that affect what I think. 

Now I’ve decided that I’m going to leave my whole family on the 20th of June. That is when I get my monthly money(?) so I’ll be able to buy food while I’m gone. I’m not sure if I’m going to kill myself while I’m gone or where I’m going to sleep but I don’t want to think about that now. I haven’t planned anything I’m going to do while gone I’m just turning of my brain basically. I can’t stand being lonely or scared of faking all my mental issues so leaving my house and family could be an escape from that. I will no longer have to worry about what they think about my actions or really worry about anything, it’s kind of like a temporary suicide. Don’t know if this was the right sub for this and I don’t even know why I wrote this.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95
230,"Constantly on My MindI don't talk to any of my friends about these sorts of things. And lately i've just been at such a low point in my life where I don't feel the need to live anymore. Throughout my whole life I just continuously lose everybody that's close to me. I've never really had a father figure because he was thrown in prison when I was 7 (I'm currently 18) for reasons that i'm not even sure of to this day. Anytime that my mother asks if I want to know what happened to him it's at a really bad time, I know it isn't anything like murder, but i've been fine without him in my life. My friend who taught me to be who I am today died in a car accident 3 years ago. I have no job, although I am looking, i've come to the conclusion that nobody wants to hire a kid that dropped out of highschool and got his GED. I haven't really been in a relationship since I was in school, as popular as I was in school, I was still depressed all the time throughout my highschool life. I just put on this fake mask hoping everyone wouldn't realize the fact that I just wanted to go home and end it on most days. I used to cut myself until one of my exs told a guidance counselor in school that I was suicidal. I've had previous attempts that just ended up in hospital runs. The whole therapy thing just didn't really seem to help. All they did was make me feel stupid about my little insignificant problems. Most nights I sit in my room just thinking about how life is so beautiful, yet I have this overbearing urge to want to end it. My mother told me that depression runs in the family, but we don't have the money to get me looked at for any possible diseases or mental health problems. I have never been on medication before either due to the low income of our household.

I'm a lesbian, but he comes over two or three times a week and sleeps over because he lives out of town and it's a bit of a commute to get to school and work. We're really close. I consider him my brother and I know he thinks of me the same way, but both of us know how girls are. If he starts dating this girl, she's not going to allow him to see me or even talk to me much. 

I haven't told him any of this, but I've been depressed and suicidal for my entire life. It's gotten to be so normal for me that I'm an expert at hiding it. I was adopted by a family who later abandoned me and now wants nothing to do with me. I got into contact with my biological family last year, but they are messed up beyond repair, and quite honestly, I hate them. Just last night my alcoholic birth mother called me up and informed me how she ""relapsed"" (for the seventh time that week), broke her wrist somehow (she think she may have punched something) and then fell asleep with a lit cigarette and later woke up on fire. She spent two months in the burn unit and was then allowed to return to her apartment. My biological sister is a convicted felon, my older brother is chronically homeless... and my younger biological brother lives with my adoptive family and doesn't want to speak to me.

As for me, my life is turned around, but there is no joy in it because I have nobody to share it with. I am in college, earn decent grades, live on my own, have a job... but it's empty.

The only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my friend, but once he's gone, there's no reason not to do it. I might end up having a superficially great future, but deep down, there will be nothing to it. I don't have medical insurance so I can't get on antidepressants or get much-needed treatment for my thyroid disease. I can go days without eating, yet still somehow manage to gain weight.

my mom just died, and i have no one to tell it to. that's a lie, but i no longer know if the person, the only person who i thought i can talk to, wants or even can talk to me. i feel like im slowly sucking her soul out with my problems, and now this? its been plainly obvious that shes tired of listening to my shit, day after day, and i don't blame her. shes been there for me for months, sometimes people need a break. but ive also got the feeling that she doesn't trust me at all. no one trusts me. i just want to reach out to someone, share things with them, and have them share things with me. ive been talking to her for months, and i know almost nothing about her. literally nothing. and its not her fault. im not blaming her, im blaming me, for falling in love with someone i don't even know. how did it happen, when i don't even know her? how can you fall in love with someone you know nothing about? and i can't tell her these things, i don't want to put this on her, i mean how do you tell someone that you can't stop thinking about them, that you dream about them at night, that you can't get them out of your mind? that was my biggest mistake, telling her that i dreamed she disappeared, and i couldn't find her. that's when she started to avoid me. or maybe the avoiding is in my head. i don't think it is though. 

my ex wife won't let me talk to my son, and hes all the way across the country. i miss my mom, i miss my brothers, i miss my son, i miss the only person who listens to my problems. i knew that eventually she would tire of my shit, because eventually every one does. everyone leaves me, it's only a matter of time. i can't stop crying.



im supposed to start school soon. ha! i'm an idiot masquerading as an intelligent person. ""cognitive neuroscience"". beyond the simple fact that im a fucking simpleton, i have ptsd, and i panic even just crossing the road. i went to this parade on the first. there were so many people, i couldn't even breath. it was my first time out of the house. but im pretending like i wasn't phased. i stood there dying inside my own head, hands shaking, trying to enjoy the music, enjoy the floats, but i felt like i was about to be killed. all the loud drums sounded like incoming missiles exploding. people kept whistling and it sounded like ordnance dropping out of the sky. this beautiful woman was standing next to me, i wanted to say hi, but i couldn't even talk. when was the last time i talked to someone face to face? months ago. and a beautiful woman? years. i make it sound like im so old, im really not. im only 23. i tried walking home, but im so fat i nearly had a heart attack. it was 4 miles, all up hill, and i didn't take any breaks, so when i got to the top, i felt so good, but it only lasted a little. after, i had so much emotion in me. i can't stop crying, ive been crying since new years eve. 

oh yeah, my support network. ha! it's reddit! people on reddit! people who obviously have zero trust for me. who knows why. it's sort of this in group kind of thing, its very cliquish, and i haven't ""made the cut"" as it were, even though ive been one of them for like a year. i mean, where else does an agoraphobic ptsd depressed fuckwit go for his support? there isn't many options. ive tried everything i could to get them to trust me. nothing has worked. i mean, they talk to me, they pretend to accept me, but i know the truth. the whole truth is they think im a spy. ha! who knew reddit could be so serious? it makes me feel even more pathetic than i already do.

ive been sober for months. i thought it might help, because before, when i was homeless and without money, drinking felt good, it drowned my sorrows, but it also took away my inhibitions. i haven't told anyone this, because i don't anyone who trusts me, but i tried killing myself a few times in 2012. i never really went through with it, just got myself close to the edge. deep down i don't really want to die, i never have, i just want the pain to go away. i love life. life is so beautiful, but so painful. the first time was in feb last year. i tried cutting myself on my leg, near the artery. i bleed till i felt weak, but then i chickened out and put a tourniquet on. i was drunk then too. i told the people at work that i was just sick, and i ran my leg into some metal. i was pretty clever, i even cut a hole in my uniform. ha, its good i got out of the army to be honest. they treated me like shit too. i was just as depressed then, and they all knew it. they just didn't care. shit, i think some wanted me to kill myself, even encouraged it. never told anyone that either. it's a good thing im not as weak willed as i think i am, or i would probably be dead.  second time was with my belt. i suffocated myself a few times, never like in a sexual way, just to get myself as close to dead as possible. scary shit. i got close once, blacked out just as i loosened it. actually, they always wanted me dead. i was in a line troop, about 3 years ago, before my ex wife took my son away, before she left me when i deployed, and the 1sgt there told me he was going to kill me, or that i should kill myself. good times. anyways, so alcohol drowns everything out, but makes me attempt suicide. so yep no alcohol .


my ex posted on christmas that im just a sperm donor. i didn't have money to send to her or my son, so she calls me nothing but a sperm donor. so i responded in full view of the world ""you're right, I have been a terrible father. I let my pride at not being able to buy him a present get in my way of skyping with him. That was selfish of me. Moving across the country was selfish of me. I know it doesn't mean much, I am sorry. I know it just sounds like excuses, I did need a change, and I needed it bad. You're a better mother to him than I have ever been a father."" she didn't believe it, neither does any of her friends. you know the worst part of all this? she tricked me into the army. i didn't want to join, i seriously didn't. and two years in she leaves me for some piece of shit miles away. then i deploy. i was actually going to kill myself in iraq, like, get shot on patrol, die a hero, or get blown up in my room. too bad the stupid iraqis were too stupid to actually hit anything with their rockets. that would have been a nice way to go. i got back from iraq, that was one of the worse days of my life. you have no idea what it's like to come back from hell, to a huge party filled with couples reuniting, dads with sons, mothers with daughters, wives to husbands. i was crying, no one noticed, they were all too wrapped up in each other. i was literally balling tears. 


anyways, i live in a wonderful place now. the rent is paid, im not homeless, i have food, but now i can't sleep. can't sleep at all. i goes day, 3-4 days with an hour a night. i slept two last night, only because ive only slept about 5 this week, and well yeah. im pretty sure everything ive posted about the one person who has been there for me is just paranoia and delusion brought on by my lack of sleep. i do love her. its strange loving someone you've never met. but now my mom died. i didn't even get to say good bye. i hadn't called her in years. part of me wanted to, but i felt so bad, because i feel like i abandoned her and my dad. they were both homeless, and i had money from the army. i could have sent them some, but i didn't. what a piece of shit son i am. and now i can't tell her im sorry. i can't tell her i love her and i miss her. death is so final. this is part of the reason i haven't killed myself, because maybe there is one person out there wishing to talk to me, that misses me, and just hasn't called me or picked up the phone. maybe people do love me and they are too afraid to show it. or maybe im too blind to see it. 

anyways, i wish i had some alcohol. maybe a friend to talk to. maybe someone to hold at night. ",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

I'm very fed up with life, I'm depressed and as a result I do stupid, reckless things, such as smoking cigarettes, driving too fast, climbing steep icy hills, getting very drunk, eating things I know are bad such as charred meat, fast food, etc. I'm afraid of what I'm going to become. Most days I'm fine but when it hits, I feel like I'm going to explode.

   My whole life I've been a people pleaser, I try to be everyone's friend. People say I'm wise or intelligent but no one really connects to me. Whether it's me being suspicious or them, I don't know. I know my family cares for me, but I don't care that they care. I want this feeling that I'm alone to go away. I say what I think and I just get ignored or they mirror what I've already told them. Why is it so hard to feel loved? I'm afraid I'll always be this way and I will leave this world having helped no one. I'm afraid that's what people think about me; That I'm just a nobody. My hope for the future used to fill the room, but now I can only hold on to a glimmer of it. 

   Some people say, I'm a prophet of doom the way I talk, but I'm just repeating the message that my journey has delivered to me. I'm not religious but I do believe in humanity. I know there's good in me, but what has expressing my goodness achieved? My well has ran dry now and all I feel is hate. Human beings are behaving recklessly, democracy has failed, money controls the government, slavery is now the accepted way of life. Can't we see that we're all the same, when you look into my eyes we're seeing ourselves. Why would we risk all these comforts of the modern existence for unnecessary social status? Why would we fill the land with trash and poison the air? Human beings are on a very bloody path that maybe no one will survive. Electricity isn't worth it if we have to pump billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Why haven't we instituted a simpler way to heat up water to power the earth? I'm so frustrated, I'm so sad, my voice isn't being heard. Everyone with my message is not being heard and I cannot even relieve my pain with some recreational marijuana because the police and laws say that it's wrong. They think that it's okay to lock someone up, ruin their future chances of getting a career, LOCK THEM UP. Caps lock means I'm seriously pissed off. They are monsters, how can we let them hurt people like that? America was supposed to be a place where freedom and other such nonsense existed but we're the opposite. Everyone thinks Bernie Sanders will wave his magic wand and fix the government, everyone thinks Trump, Clinton, etc. Why do they think government will fix a damn thing? The government is just a shadow of the corporations and big time billionaires. The world has fallen to money, or perhaps just the United States has fallen to idiocy. 

   I'm not going to die, but I am going to hasten my exit as much I can. Hopefully I don't get fat. Hopefully I find a woman who loves me, even though I'm damaged. 
   Oh yeah, my story. I was born on the outskirts of a very small town. I grew up poor and my parents were young and stupid. But my mother instilled the dream in me to make it out of the slums. My teachers seemed to agree with her, I was soo smart, blah blah blah. The students all knew I was the smart kid, but I was never good at socializing. I never had a girlfriend, even though I look fine. I have horrible chest and back acne, even though I'm 23, and maybe it has always affected my self-confidence. I would shun swimming with anyone, even though I loved it. I would say that I hated swimming. I've had sex with three women, all were quite attractive but I don't know. All of the interactions seemed empty, there was no feeling from either of us. Why can't I have a girl that loves me? At my core, I think that is where my anger stems. I just want a fucking hug, I want a female friend who wants to see me and have fun together. Not just have sex, I don't care if that ever happens again. I'm not even afraid of girls anymore, I've struggled so much that I'm encased in steel. But how will they handle someone like me?
    After highschool, I got a full ride through college; but I wasn't prepared to live on my own. I was so stressed out having to run back and forth all the time between a job and classes. I let my social life take over and started ditching all of my classes. It was the first experience I had with failure and it devastated my psyche. What once was a happy go lucky soul became cold and distant.
     Then last year, I fell in love with a woman. She was so strong and smart, not to mention incredibly beautiful. She sang and danced and flirted with everyone. She was always so happy and loving, we watched movies and went for walks, played games, talked, she even played with my hair for like 20 minutes. I felt like I was in Heaven. After we met, I felt like my inner child returned. The only thing was, she was my best friends girlfriend. But he was always cynical when he talked about her in private. ""She's rich, spoiled, she'll cheat on me, I'm gonna break up with her etc"" He never had much hope they would make it, but of course he loved her too. I think he was just afraid she would leave him. He gave me permission to woo her to my hearts content.  And well, it was only the second time I had felt that way for someone and the first time didn't hit me quite as hard.  I felt hopeless the whole time even though things appeared to be working out quite well for me. Every sentence I spoke was one more nail in the coffin of our relationship.

   Then we had sex, and it was fine but after that I didn't know how to interact with her. Plus she lives an hour away and I'm poor and have no car. So we drifted apart and now she has a boyfriend. I saw him for the first time on facebook earlier and my heart dropped. I wanted to call her and saying something like, ""I saw your profile picture, you look beautiful and so does he"" but when we talk I don't know what to say. Anything that I come up with or think about beforehand is instantly gone when I hear that angelic voice. I'm giving her space right now, I think that's the right move. But how can I ignore the pain of loneliness and rejection. She obviously doesn't care for me the way I do for her. I don't know. She asked me if I was in love with her, she's very perceptive. I said no, we were just attracted to each other. I wish I had told her the truth, even though it would've had the same result. My mentor told me to forget about her. But I can't do that! It's on my mind 24/7, when I see words my mind reforms them to her name. Vague references which have nothing to do with her brings her to my mind. I've thought about blocking her on facebook and going out to find the easiest woman out there to fuck, but that doesn't sit well with my emotional side, I want her. And I can't give up on that.

   I'm so tired, I don't want to work a 40 hour week. I want to raise my own food, power my oven with science to store said food over winter. I want to drink the water from the ground and make my clothes from the fibers, grown from the investment of time. Cities are an abomination and will be the death of us all. I love everyone and I do not want to die but my dream seems hopeless, so I'm gonna go have a cigarette, even though I don't smoke. Then I'm gonna put in an application to Ramey Auto Parts because my dream is so far away. I wish I had the guts to end my life, but I'm terrified of what it'll do to my family. I think I just want to die so she'll understand, I couldn't live without her.

It's not that I don't want to be twenty. It's that I don't want the idea that there's another year ahead. Another year of soul-crushing loneliness. Another year of self-hatred. Another year of wanting to die. I don't want there to be a future for me, because I know it won't ever be a good one. 
I'm the only person I've met in my entire life that I truly think is hopeless. I see nothing in myself. An ugly, toxic piece of shit dead set on the path to my inevitable empty funeral. And a few days ago, it finally set in. I'm just not getting the return on investment I need. I'm unloved--no family, no lover, and hardly any of what youd call friends--and honestly pretty unlovable (ugly face, ugly body, ugly personality: the trifecta) and considering love is one of the only things that keeps me going, I guess I just realized how meaningless it all is. I just can't keep living for the people I care about and love anymore. Its just not enough.

I am your average, stupid, emotional teenager. There's nothing great about me. I'm incredibly shy and have 2 people who I consider close-ish friends. I feel so different from everybody else. I'm ugly, fat, and so shut in. I can read people so well, I swear. When I talk to people sometimes, I can see their disgust. ""why do I have to sit next to her?"" ""why do I have to work with her?"" ""why do I have to help her?"" I know what you're thinking, it's all in my head. No it's not. I get made fun of, not to my face but I hear it. They talk about me as if I'm not there. Admitting that I get made fun of is embarrassing. I feel so degraded, like my humanity is stripped from me. I'm such a freak. I blush easily. I don't talk. I'm a loser. 

I feel like it doesn't get better after this. I feel like I won't make it into a legitimate college because of the drop in my grades this year. My graduation next year signifies a lot. I'm the youngest in my family and my parents have been waiting 9 years for my graduation to split up. The tension in my house is hard to deal with. None of my siblings get along, no one. I come home, go to my room, close my door and that's that. I've been told multiple times by my brother that I don't fit in with our family. I don't fit in anywhere. He uses what they call me at school against me and I know he's embarrassed of me being his sister. I hate fighting, violence, anything like that and that's just what my family's about. Everyone tries so hard to get along but everything always ends in a fight. 

I don't want to go to school anymore. I've been skipping any assignment that has to do with presenting because I feel like I'll just start crying. My teachers think I'm some freak who doesn't talk and doesn't have any friends.

It’s so addictive to me. It’s the only thing that really makes me feel better. I was in and out of the inpatient hospital earlier this year for attempts, and they put me on Prozac. It does help my mood by the tiniest amount and makes me less of an asshole- but it doesn’t change the fact that I want to slice every last inch of my skin open and die. 
What the hell is wrong with me. I have no goddamn self preservation instinct and I feel like a freak. I can’t keep doing this but I’ve been doing it for years and I don’t know how to stop. I feel like every time I have to do it I go deeper because otherwise I feel like it’s not worth it if it’s not worse than the last. 
I’m going to either end up dead or so heavily scarred with the rate I’m going that I’m going to be wearing long sleeves and pants for the rest of my life. I have four years worth of scars already and it’s only getting fucking worse. 
I went swimming the other fucking week and NEVER AGAIN. Never again. Fuck. I’m so tired of a stupid piece of metal having control over me for so long. People tell me not to do it because “I’m so young” but I’ve been doing it for at least 5 years now, since I was 12, and it’s one of the only things that’s remained a constant- through the abuse, processing the abuse, toxic relationships, everything. It’s the one thing I take comfort in. Sometimes I wish I was addicted to drugs instead. It’s so much more socially acceptable. With s/h I have to pretend that I’m always okay and I have to keep my arms and legs covered or else I’ll be questioned and looked at weird. I hate this so much. I hate that cutting leaves scars and I hate that I need my scars as validation but somehow I hate that they exist at the same time. 
When I was inpatient last time, a month ago, one of the nurses told me I wasn’t ever going to find love because of my scars. I don’t know if I believe that, but I know it’s going to make shit so much harder. I already feel worthless. I don’t know how to change. I’m so fucked up from the trauma and shit that no one should have to deal with me. Literally none of my friends know how to deal with it. They try but I made the mistake of telling them about s/h and all they can say is “omg don’t do that”. But what am I supposed to expect? It’s a lot to deal with. They deserve better. So now I just shut up about it and tell them I’m clean and wear my stupid fucking sleeves in the Texas summer. I fucking hate myself.
I’m so fucked up that I don’t know where I would even start to heal. Fuck my dad. Fuck him. He gave me a lovely eating disorder that never fucking leaves, PTSD, a fear of all men, depression, anxiety, and definitely issues past that. What the fuck kind of person beats the shit out of a 12 year old??? It makes me feel like I deserved it because why else would it have happened? I’m a fucking terrible person now so I probably did deserve it. All I do is lie, self harm, and argue with my family. I have no value in this world. I contribute absolutely nothing to society. My friends deserve so much better than my toxic ass. I’m too depressed for anyone to deal with, so I just act like I’m not.

I hate being at school. Less than 300 kids total, everyone knows your name and face and damn social security number. Bible belt bullshit. That's actually part of what I think caused her to kill herself but that's a really long story. On the 2 month anniversary I had a panic attack within the first hour of being at school and had to go home. I kept seeing her everywhere in everything. I talked to my guidance counselor who is THE ONLY PERSON to ever make me feel better about it and she's leaving to go to a different school tomorrow which is really damn fantastic.


I've been depressed for three years at least. It was horrible last year. My teacher helped me. Got on meds. Things were kind of okay. Then she died. I stopped taking them because they made me have nightmares to begin with, but when she died I just saw her in one and couldn't do it. And also because of a discussion I had with her about me getting on meds, long story short I knew she had been on them for depression and had stopped taking them... So, in a messed up way a part of me wanted to be where she was at that time because I needed t understand. I've been off them since august.


Shrink is getting me new meds soon but that's not the issue. Long story fucking short, i feel like time is a really thick, strong ass rubber band that is floating a direction and i am a solid object in its path.

319,"Everything I am, was, or ever will be can be reduced to three letters: B P DI am all the crazy ex-girlfriend stories. I am all the abusive wives and mothers who hurt their husbands and children. I am all the power-hungry, desperate anxious women willing to hurt anything else to avoid pain. I am all the manipulative women who performs to be whatever you want her to be until you threaten to leave, and then I am a screaming mess, knowing just how to hurt you, just what to say to tear you to pieces, and then begging you not to leave. I am all the women who inexplicably have people who like her despite the fact that she is abusive. I am all the women who don't have a real personality and just put on whatever everyone else wants her to be. I am all the women who ensnare men with her manipulative, faux-empathetic, alluring tactics only to rip off the mask and reveal nothing short of a nightmare. I am all the abusive women who still think like children, only *actually* malicious, truly evil. I am the reason for the stigma against mental health. I am all the women who don't want treatment because she does not think it can work - not because it's impossible, but because she also doesn't want to get better well enough, and how can I get better if I don't want to? 

I use and abuse people, and throw them away once they're no longer useful. I treat people like drugs, not like human beings. My guilt is manufactured as a social response. I'm a sociopath. This isn't some ""oh, I'm depressed and that's why I feel this way"" thing. It really *is* that when I'm happy, it's because I'm denying the truth of who I am. This isn't some ""I'm just sad and blah de blah I'm saying I'm a sociopath because I feel guilty"" thing. This is me telling you in my perfectly lucid mind that I am a sociopath... and I hate myself. How could someone with BPD be lucid and *not* hate themselves, considering everything that one with BPD is, that people with BPD have done? People with my personality - my *exact* personality, have been responsible for so much. My own mother was like this and I'm a complete wreck and our family is fallen apart and my two stepsisters will probably attempt suicide at some point in their lives because of how fucked-up she is. And that? That's me. That's everything I am or was or ever will be. You can say I have insight, but that doesn't make a difference if I won't use it. 

I don't want to die, but I feel like most of the abused men who have been partnered with a BPD would have preferred that their BPD vanish into the night and found later in a car full of CO with a body full of alcohol and benzos, than have to deal with years of abuse. 

I post here likely because I want reassurance and validation, but I really don't deserve it. I don't know that I'll be in immediate danger, but I honestly think I'll kill myself soon, just like the way I tried before - only this time, I won't call anyone for help when I do the deed, and I'll do it correctly.

325,"How do you find the motivation to keep going?Just one simple question - how do you find the motivation to keep going? I am honestly looking for reasons that life is worth living. I'm having a very hard time finding any answers.

People always suggest to find hobbies. I play guitar, write music, create digital art, draw, design video games, and write short stories. These are all ok as distractions I guess, but doesn't really change how I feel about anything.

I have an amazing job. I have worked so hard and for so many years to be here. I have a strong sense of accomplishment about this. But, now that I have proved to myself I can do this - now what?

I know that there are people who have it worse than me. I volunteer and give basic computer training to developmentally disabled children and adults. I like being able to help when I can.. but I don't feel like this is the reason.

For a long time, my biggest motivation was to one day have a wife and kids. I'm 32 now and just seem to be having horrible luck with women. I will go on a few dates, and things go well at first, but as they get to know me, they either get bored, or don't like who I am? I don't know what it is exactly, but it doesn't take them very long for them to move on. When I'm dating, I don't act mopey or sad like I might be coming across in this post. They genuinely seem to be having fun when we're together. I know I'm not perfect, but I don't think I'm a bad person. I feel like the door is closing pretty quickly here for me.

I have no close friends. It's not from a lack of trying, but I find it very difficult to make any kind of meaningful friendships. I have no family left.

The problem is that we don’t know who to reach out to in order to assure his safety, as our school would contact his family and that would ultimately end up escalating the issue. 

We’ve told him that we’re willing to offer any supports necessary for him right now and have been pushing him to talk to our guidance advisors, but (partially due to the stigma) he is unwilling to and says that he can ‘get through this’.

She didn't bother me much until after I moved to be with my wife. We all lived together when we first got married because, well my partner was too lazy to work at the time and I struggled to find a job when I moved and mental illness took over me. She always screamed and freaked out over little things, blasted music, and made messes non-stop. Slept nude from the waist down with the door open. Went threw my stuff ect. She became unbearable. The fights between everyone made it hard to bear. And the constant talk of who died today, how and other depressing topics. She moved out about six years ago to care for her mother and it's been nice. We got back on our feet and made a life here. Well, her mom died, and her family is selling the house she is currently in. Two of her siblings who live like 4 hours away offered her a very nice place to live but she freaked out and started blubbering not wanting to be that far from her daughter. So every excuse she had she used. She has a super bad knee and can't get up the stairs to the only bathroom or her old bedroom.

I was talking to a housemate and she said that I should go a see a psychologist. She's studying psychology and she said I'm a bit traumatized with my past (my parents used to beat me up and also psychologically abuse me).

Besides that my father was a criminal investigator/detective. Since I was little he taught me to always read people consciously, physically and mentally, watch out for minor changes in their faces and bodies and pay attention for triggers. I'm always doing that, besides that I'm always analyzing where I'm at, looking for threats and escape routes or safe places, trying to blend in and not look like an easy victim.

I like to read people and do a small mental list, expecting everything. I'm a bit antisocial but I kind of hang out with everyone in my college class, I'm pretty good at putting on a character depending on who I'm talking to, I can be a intellectual, an out-going party guy, an introvert, a cool guy, I basically put the adequate character for the person I'm talking to. My housemate also says I'm a bit manipulative and not very open, I told her basically everything that there's to know about me to her, how I read people, how I plan to act if they attack me and how I like people less than animals, and that I told her that not because I trust her but because she intrigues me (she had a bit of a ruff past and even have done self-harm) and she doesn't pose a threat.

I also can't keep a relationship or friendship very long and even thought I talk to my maternal side of family especially my mom and grandma, they don't really know me and I don't really trust them nor forget what they have done.

I practiced krav-maga, kickboxing and muay-thay and my father taught me aikido and self-defense and he usually would just attack me and tell me to defend myself.

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was very young and had to take meds.

My mom is just a narcissist who thinks she’s always right and is better than everyone else.

I'm just sick tired of everything, I want to move far away and start from zero, met someone have a family and live. God help me please, Jesus have mercy on me.

Someone please, what should I do, i just feel like things are caving in sometimes and all gets worse because I'm all alone, because I can't connect to someone in a really deep level. 

I'm going to drop out of college, the degree that I'm taking (History) don't fit me at all, I'm thinking in joining the Police and becoming a detective or something like that, because I kind of identify with that job I think.

I think that I just don't end my life because that's a sin, God is my only true friend at the moment and his love for me keeps me alive to.

I made a lot of friends and lost nearly all of them, one after another, for reasons ranging from disagreements about politics to someone legitimately trying to manipulate my friends into dumping me because they thought I was making everyone else depressed. Ever since then, that person has been stalking me. Another person also started stalking me after they decided to end our friendship, because I was ""being too nice"" to other people, and he thought it was fake of me. I've lost other friends, countless friends, throughout the years, and these aren't the ones that have hurt the most, but they're more in a string of bad endings to friendships that always seem to be my fault. So I've been thinking I must deserve it. 

I got up today thinking about ending my life, and that's all I've been able to think about, all day long. My family would get over it. My friends would find new friends, if they haven't already. The people who live to torment me will probably be pleased as pie. Everyone can just go on without me and it'll be fine.

I'm 22, saving up for university, or at least that's what I tell people.
I work a dead end job, read books, and just live.
For the past five years I felt like I'm slowly fading away, I don't even feel joy from anything anymore, not reading, not masturbating or having sex, not playing video games.
I even quit smoking, because why smoke when it doesn't even do anything anymore? 

Lately I've just hit my emotional bottom, where I just sit and think to myself ""Holy shit, this isn't going anywhere, what's the fucking point anymore?""

I don't see any point in living, there's no goal to achieve, and even if I'll make one myself it would just be some hollow thing used to pass the time towards the inevitable.Hell, I even tried giving myself a goal, turns out it didn't do anything to me, just kept me busy for a little while.

 I don't care about other people, I don't care about being moral and staying alive just to make others happy or because ""it's the right thing"". Maybe I'll start practicing extreme sports, maybe then I'll feel alive, maybe I'll finally die without people asking questions.

It's been a long time since life had appeal, and I don't think I'll manage to keep on living for long before I'll lose my mind and just end it.

I'd be lying if I was saying I'll do it soon, but... I have my limits.
Hopefully when the time comes I won't fuck it up and end up with brain damage, otherwise I'll be in a living hell until I'd die naturally.
That's pretty much the only thing that worries me about killing myself. Just fucking it up and ending up in an even worse situation, as hard as it is to imagine right now.

379,"I can't stop thinking of ending it all...Through my life I've had issues with anxiety and depression do to my up bringing. I'm  now 30 years old, turning 31 on Feb. I dropped out of community college and moved to NY when I was 25 working as a concierge. I was hoping by the time I got to 30, I would have some sort of idea of what I want to do with my life, and that I would change enough to get my ass up and make something out of myself. Now, do to the Pandemic, I lost my job, and I had to move back into my parents place.  I've been living there since the pandemic had started. 

 As I stayed there my mental heath worsened. I don't believe that I am meant for this world, everyone around, including my siblings, are still able to work and make a living. My younger sister is currently making moves to close on a new house, My older brother is an attorney and helping his wife get her baking business off the ground. My older sister is not doing as well as them, but she still manages to find work and is living with her boyfriend. I feel like I am a tremendous burden on my family and friends.  They all still show love and support, except my father. My father as always been an angry man and his disappointment in me only grows, and I sense my brother is getting tired of me as well. 

My best friend had a pretty good paying job but he also lost it do to the Pandemic. With the money he saved up, he decided to travel west to find him self. He knew what staying at my parents house was doing to my mental state and convinced me to fly out and join him mid November. He thinks it would help me break out of this mental state and perhaps find myself. I'm here now trying to create a routine that will change my state of mind. We meditate, make goals to reach, exercise, and take breaks by camping out in nature. Some days I feel okay, but every morning is the same. I wake up immediately filled with anxiety and depression. I meditate to try and see that these are just negative thoughts and they don't make who I am. It's very very difficult. I can also see that my friend is getting tired of my behavior.

  I'm left with the feeling that I am not like everyone around me. I wouldn't be able to survive on my own. Every job I got was from help of my parents, and I was fired from most of them. The only reason I end up traveling is due to my best friend convincing me to go and he would cover most expenses. I always need saving, I always need someone to do something for me. I never know what is the right thing to do. I enjoy art (story boarding/ character design) and comedy, two professions that require a lot of effort and time and I'm already 31, I feel hopeless to achieve such goals.  I am the dead beat brother in every tv show or movie. I am PATHETIC!!!  

Everyday I have thoughts to end it all. I spend hours thinking on how I would do it, what's the most painless way to go. The only thing that's honestly keeping me from doing it is that it would literally destroy my family. I've started writing notes, but I know nothing I can say would help my family if I'm gone. I almost wish I had shitty family so this would be easier but I know to have such a support system is a blessing and I remined myself that I am lucky to have them. I feel stuck in misery. I realize that they're people out there that are much worse off, but that doesn't make me feel any better.

It wasn't this way, but about four years ago I lost my best friend and I couldn't find any reason to even smile, yet I wasn't allowed to mourn because people looked at me as the one who had to remain strong so that it didn't all come crashing down, or at least it felt that way. Now I don't feels depressed for this, it was 4 years ago and I've come to accept what happened, I have no regrets about it, I said he told me everything we had to and wanted to while he was alive, so there were no words unsaid.

This however brings another problem, while going to grief I had a reason to live, or at least it felt that way, I wasn't living for me anymore, I now had to live life for me and for him, because he loved life, but after I came to accept his passing it slowly became dull, Life no longer felt like life.

I do have friends whom I love and my family is great, I don't have bad grades or suffer from bullying, it's just that living is no longer appealing to me, my friends and family are clever enough to stop me from killing myself, they know me very well, so killing myself is not something that I try often, however I do wish I could just up and die, I don't fear death, I embrace the idea of me dying, I wish my bus would drive off the cliff, or for a Stray bullet to hit me in the back of the head.

386,"Think my ex might be contemplating suicide...I already know what a lot of people will say... she's my ex and it isn't my problem.  Except it is.  I still care about her a lot.  She was the one who ended things a few months ago.  We were together for 3 years and she chose to end things 5 das before her birthday.  

Now here is where it gets hard for me to talk about.  I was not the best partner to her at all.  In fact, saying that is a huge understatement.   I always expected more out of her than what she could give.  I made nasty comments about how she looked.  I made fun of her.  I called her names.  I lied to her.  I did inappropriate things with other women behind her back.  I hit on her female friends.  I hit on women she didn't know.  I kept in contact with old girlfriends and flirted with them openly.  I pressured her for threesomes with friends of mine.  I pressured her for an open relationship which she didn't want.  I tried to get her to agree to let me bring a triad into our relationship.  I blamed her depression for my own bad behavior.  And looking back I know I was the cause of it (her depression.)  She started taking anti-depressants when we were together and as far as I know she still takes them.  I know I'm a piece of shit.  I know I don't deserve to be happy with anyone after the way I've treated others.  (It's not like she was the first.)  It was her leaving me that made me realize I need to re-evaluate the way I treat others.  I have a real problem empathizing with people.  And so I've decided to just not enter into another relationship.  

And she had a rough life before me.  She has OCD (clinically diagnosed.)  She got beat up on a regular basis growing up.  And her ex-husband used to beat her up.  There were also things that happened with an older male family member when she was a teenager that shouldn't have happened.   

As far as why I think she's contemplating suicide...  the things I'm going to mention here have all happened over the last couple of months.  She has made a few comments about how she will be dead soon.  She had several aunts die in their 40s.  She keeps talking about how the women in her family all die young.  

She has a lot of medical bills she's been trying to pay.  She recently got a bonus at work and went on a shopping spree for herself.  She bought herself a really expensive top-shelf bottle of Whiskey, among other things.  SHe was telling me about it and she was like, ""I know I could have used the money to pay my medical bills down.  But I'm going to die one day.  I might as well have a good time while I can.""  

She was sick not too long ago and couldn't get rid of the cough.  At one point she made the comment, ""Maybe I'll get lucky and find out I have stage 4 lung cancer like Walter White.""  

I don't like hearing her say this stuff.  She never used to talk like this.  I knew her for a year before I dated her.  She used to be so full of life.  

She posted a meme on Facebook the other night that said, ""I'm tired of having to apologize for the monster I've become.  No one ever apologized for making me this way.""  And a couple of nights before that she posted one that said ""If I disappeared would anyone even miss me?""  

But the thing that really got me was last night...  She is really into music.  I mean really into it.  She is one of those people that has music on all the time.  No matter what she's doing.  And she posts songs on Facebook pretty regularly that reflect her mood.  I don't like any of the music she listens to so I rarely paid any attention to these posts.  But idk... last night she posted a song that I just felt compelled to click on.  I wish I wouldn't have.  This song really bothered me.  It was eerie and unsettling and really disturbed me.  I would link it but I don't know if this sub allows links.  It was The Final Cut by Pink Floyd if anyone is wondering.  It's very obviously a song about wanting to kill yourself.  There are lines about ""What would you do if you saw my dark side?"" and holding a blade in shaking hands, etc.  I was not expecting that at all when I clicked on it.  I thought they were a bunch of hippies who's songs are mostly about drugs and not needing no education, lol.  And she posted it with no context, no nothing.  It was just a Youtube link. 

I know people will probably tell me to stay the hell off her social media.  But we are still friends on facebook.  I'm going to see her posts.  I don't know if I'm just reading too much into these posts and her recent comments about death or what. Or maybe she is trying to get someone's attention.  She was going to Therapy the whole time I was with her and as far as I know, she still is.

393,"I tried to kill myself today.Back in December I tried to kill myself twice. Once with pills, and once with a train. The pills didn't work so about a week later I walked a couple miles to some railroad tracks outside of town by a cemetery. I waited in the cold for a few hours there but a train never came. I ended up calling the suicide hotline while I was there and they had a sheriff come pick me up and take me to the hospital where I spent 5 days in the psych ward till they kicked me out on Christmas Eve. 

After that I put in my 2 weeks notice at my job of 5 years to move back home to my dad's house to get away from the all the drugs and violence in the town that I moved to after high school. I had fallen in with a bad crowd in that town and used weed to self medicate and became a stoner but I stopped smoking when I went into the hospital. Luckily I was able to pass a drug test and got a job at a Walgreens about a mile from my dad's house but I hated that job. I worked there for 2 days until I just stopped going to work. I stopped taking my meds and waited for the cold chill here in the midwest to stop so I could go down to the tracks again to kill myself. 

I waited on an old railroad tie while drinking the tall boys I brought with me waiting for a train. I ended up missing the first train that went by because I couldn't get to the tracks fast enough so I walked a little further down and waited under a bridge for another train to come, but it never did so I just walked home.

I don't even know what to do anymore, I guess tomorrow I'll check myself into the hospital again. I don't really want to kill myself but I hate my life and don't want to live anymore. I just don't know anymore. ",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

395,"I keep putting it off but I think it's finally time.- I'm 33 years old.

- I can't work because I'm too crazy.  All my friends think I'm just lazy.  Maybe they're right.

- I live with my mother.

- My girlfriend hates me.  Or she sure as fuck acts like she does.  It seems like everything I do is wrong, an excuse to lecture me on why I suck, etc.

- I can't stand most of my friends and it's mutual.

- I'm grossly overweight thanks to a combination of hormonal imbalances, SSRIs, birth control, eating disorders and a host of other fun things, so even if I were the greatest person in the world no one would ever want me.  

- I have a bunch of gyn type problems that make my periods fucking miserable and leave me bedridden for over a week per month.  

- My psychiatrist treats me like crap.  

- I don't enjoy anything.  Everything bores me.  

- Even if I did enjoy anything, I have massive credit card debt from all the times I've tried activities hoping to enjoy them, and no income to pay them off.  I do get disability but all that goes to rent.  All my friends think I'm a big faker and wasting taxpayer money because I'm trying to find something that makes my life bearable.  Again they may be right.

- Everyone who actually loved me is already dead.

- I'm in constant pain but am apparently perfectly healthy so all my doctor can offer is ""lose weight.""  Which is hard to do when it hurts to sit, stand or walk.  Maybe I could if I felt motivated to, but I don't; this pain predates my being fat, so while I'm sure that doesn't help, it's not the cause, nor does it seem to really be making it worse.

- My memory is basically shot.  I can't focus on anything.  

- I'm stuck taking care of a cat I can't fucking stand who for some reason attached herself to me.  So all day I just hear nonstop yowling if I try to separate myself from her, have a giant fat cat crawling on me, or have her chewing electronic wires in half/clawing my furniture to shreds/ruining something or other.  She also screams and howls if I leave the house for too long (say, an hour or more).  Not sure what she'll do when I'm dead, but I guess that's not my problem, since I'll be dead.  I briefly thought about taking her with me because I thought she'd be so upset if I died but that's stupid - she deserves to live and she'll forget about me pretty fast.  Wouldn't really do that.

- I have a decent amount of money in savings and stocks left to me by well-intentioned relatives.  If I die, my mom can use that to pay off her debts and live comfortably for a few years (she's been 'secretly' stealing from it all for ages anyway).  She's 73 and I need to die before she does.  Otherwise I'll be completely alone.  

- I'm never going to be a mom, which is all I've wanted since I was 16 and what I've looked forward to most in life, because I'm too fucking crazy to be a parent.

- The only thing keeping me alive is my fear of death and that's a stupid reason to live.


Got my amazon cart loaded up with everything I'll need to leave all this shit behind.  Just need to find the guts to actually do it.  I hate how much I fear nothingness/nonexistence.  I mean, I won't even be aware of it, so why fear it?  ",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

He makes weird comments. Like “damn you be looking thick” and shit. He walked by one night and goes “nice ass [my name]”. I’ve told him to stop but he goes “It’s just a joke relax”. 

Not to mention the touching. Oh the touching. I need more than two hands to count the amount of times he’s touched me. He spanked me in the rear countless times. I have TOLD him I don’t like it. At all. He’s said sorry but you know he doesn’t care about it because he will not stop. He constantly will find anyway to make physical contact with me. He will do weird things like pat me on the head and shit which wouldn’t be a big deal without the context. I don’t feel comfortable around him. Not to mention his mother won’t do squat because she views him as an angel.

472,"Why my life sucks So I have this friend who I was really good friends with. She was one of my closest friends last year, and even though we had a few issues in the beginning I really cared about her. About 2 weeks before COVID and quarantine I started to have feelings for her, and I asked her out. She the proceeded to say “I don’t know” and “I need time” for a month and a half. During that time our friendship became strained and awkward, and I straight up hit on her at times which made her uncomfortable. And eventually she finally said straight up no. After leading me on for a month and a half. After that there was a while where we didn’t really talk to each other, but at the beginning of the school year this year we started taking again. Then like two months ago she started avoiding me and not answering my texts. I confronted her about it and we fought for awhile and we told each other how the we had each hurt each other and we apologized and agreed to give each other a month of space before resuming our friendship. I assumed we were all good now. I gave her the month, then I texted her, “hey it’s been a month. are we ok now?” She read my text and didn’t answer. So I gave her a few more days. She still wouldn’t talk to me. I texted her again only this time she had blocked me. I tried to talk to her and she kept avoiding me. I finally asked one of our mutual friends to tell her to talk to me and she told my friend, “ew effff no”. And now I’m deeply hurt because one of my best friends just abandoned me because I liked her and she dragged it out and made me think I had a chance with her.",teenagers,teenager,0.80
473,"The wooden ball in avocados are a shitty toy I’m tired of getting them every time I cut open an avocado. You would think the avocado companies would probably have gotten rid of them by now. But no, they’ve had the same dumb toy for thousands of years. They’re horrible toys, they don’t bounce, you can’t catch it because they’re so slippery, and they really hurt when they hit you. I don’t know why they can’t just mix it up a bit. Don’t get me wrong I love avocados but it would be fun to have a surprise next time I cut one open.

And you don’t always have to vote for your own party, my family votes for republican unless the person representing is an absolute trash candidate (*cough cough trump cough cough*)

I’ve seen so much negativity towards both parties and I just don’t think it’s right

I’ve known many nice people from both parties who get along really well, they just happen to have different political values and that’s okay

527,"Down sad Hey to whoever’s reading this, just making  this post to sort of rant. Can’t really talk to anyone I know or whatever so I’m posting it here. Feeling shit tbh, in like every part of my life. Thought these holidays would help me sort everything out and whatnot but they did nothing tbh. I hate school, but I’m somewhat smart, I get good marks on math and science but recently they’ve been decreasing, I can’t stand going there tho, numerous reasons. My best friend is very smart his like top 1 student smart and my parents can’t go a minute without comparing us. I’m still rly good friends with him but they make me feel like cutting bonds with him. My social life is abysmal, mainly bc of my own doing, besides the friend from school I have like 3 others who I know don’t really care abt me. Most days I sit studying and watching some anime. My relationship with my parents has really gone down hill. Last year it took a serious turn for the worst, there were weeks where my mother refused to talk to me and my father only talked to me about my school work. At one point my mother wanted to kick me out for reasons I’m still unsure. This all led to me developing unhealthy habits, a little self harm but mainly an eating addiction, so you can assume I put on a lot of weight. So in September I started gyming in my uncles garage. I would train everyday for about 3 months, and I was making good progress. But for better or worse my father forced me to stop because I wasn’t doing what my body needed apparently. In response to this I started eating  a shit ton again. During October me and I girl I knew for about 6 months at that time started dating. It ended with her ghosting me essentially. Our country’s in another lockdown so it was easy for her. That affected me pretty badly, I still think about her everyday . As you can imagine, all these things add up to me being pretty sad. I’ve jumped between telling myself to suck it up and move on and saying that I do deserve to be happy sometimes. I got the rona recently and damn did I get it at the wrong time, I sit it bed all day and do nothing. All in all I know that I’m feeling sorry for myself and that this post is a mess.

561,"People giving advice to help your mental health are annoying This might very well just be a small margin of people who feal this way. But i hate when people say ""oh you can do it. It's gonna be okay. You are strong. Everything's going to be okay. You just have to try again""

And it's not as much about what they say but more about the idea that if every time you fell down you just HAVE to try again and have to keep fighting it always.

For me at least thats just plain wrong and is really annoying because ""yes i have tried to fix my mental health for like 9 years i think and everytime it would be good for about 1/2 - 1 year and puff i gotta start over... From scratch... Again...""

And i have simply gave up now and accepted that this isn't worth it because everytime I got broken down i got weaker, not stronger.
And even when I fixed it i was scared of when it broke so instead of depression, grief and anxiety i just got worse anxiety.

Anyway my life's shit and i don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to  kill myself either so I guess imma just lay down.

Anyway thanks for reading my trash and have great night y'all be nice.

And if I wasn't happy enough when we talked about the pandemic and how it sucks that our senior year is kinda getting ruined by it she sends me a voice clip of her talking about it cause she ""can't articulate it in writing"" and I got to hear her after like six months which was a godsend.

And then she's like ""I was looking forward to homecoming"" to which I'm like ""same"" and she says ""hopefully we'll have prom"" and even though I'm probably reading too much into it with everything that's been happening it kinda feels like she was sending an ""ask me"" vibe but I can't be sure.

583,"Tiktok is as f*cking bad as you guys may think So, yes I installed tiktok about week or two ago. Before ya'll go nuts on me, the only reason installed it is because of the large music community on platform, not to dance to a soundtrack that has a closer resemblence to a fart than a song. And I was enjoying my experience until people started following me. Random people with anime profiles and whatnot. So, I didn't see the harm in following them back, until one of them sent me this demented video...

The video had some trashy rap song in the background and in a big bold caption clearly visible in the middle of the screen it said this: ""If you love your Mom pass this to 20 people. A girl ignored this and her mom died 365 days later sorry I can't ignore this Cuz I love my mom ❤❤❤❤❤💍 I ain't risking it"" I didn't ignore it at all I instantly reported it to Tiktok saying a post like that has an extremely high probability to harm the millions of young, naive, children on their platform. While I was waiting for a response I found that the post had nearly 40k likes and was posted well over a year ago. Also the comment section was filled with dense, empty-handed remarks like ""ppl who think it real 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡"" I think the clowns are the people who can't sympathize for the children on that godforsaken app.

So, what did tiktok have to say about this post in response to my report
