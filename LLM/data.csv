10,"first post/ love my husband but i am so jealousso here it goes

i am almost 30 and married to the most amazing guy, i mean just amazing. he comes from the greatest family, is practically a genius and everyone just loves hi am when they meet hi am. then there is me....i come from the most dysfunctional family and people rarely like me once they get to know me.

my biggest issue now is i am so jealous of my husband. he has everything, a wonderful family, support, he is spoiled but not a brat, he has an amazing job making amazing money. 

i went to university and accomplished two degrees......for nothing. i struggled all of my life to pave a good path for me where i could feel accomplished. i have never had support from my family, financial or otherwise, but working almost 60 hrs a week someti ames and going to school full ti ame, i did it.  

however now, where we live, i cannot work. i am a housewife and i hate it. everything i prided myself on (being a hard worker and dedicated) was for nothing. i have come to the realization that my professional life is now over, and althoughugh i am so grateful to my husband for everything he has given me, i have ended up being the only thing i have never ever wanted to be, a housewife.

i do not want kids, never did, because i have always just wanted to work. i never planned on being extraordinary or making tons of money, just working enough to live my life since my parents has barely anything when i was growing up. 

i have no friends because i never had ti ame during that part of my life (early 20's) to make and keep friends. i feel my only purpose now is to serve my husband and make sure he is happy, and i love that, do not get me wrong, but i feel so empty. i lack a purpose now and i am not sure what to do. people say join clubs, find hobbies, i have tried but the only thing i am good at is working. 

sorry if this is confusing, i am rambling getting out a mix of emotions here. how is it i am so grateful for the things in my life, but still so sad and empty? ",depression,depression,0.77

to my family: i am so sorry for the grief and guilt i am leaving you with.  i know every single person in this family is going to feel guilty, because of me, and i hate that so much.  this is not your fault.  i wish i could take that away, you do not deserve it.  i pushed you all away.  i could not say goodbye, because i have made up my mind, and i do not want to risk you feeling any worse, in case you are not ready to forgive me.  i know you would, especially if you knew what was coming, but i am leaving regardless.

please have a group hug for me, because i would have really loved to hug you all one last ti ame.  i am so sorry i did not say goodbye, but this will have to do.

my motive is pretty self evident, but if you need me to clarify: my entire life slipped away.  the loss of \[ex-wife\], onset mental illness, and severe depression.  there is no hope for me now, i have lost too much.  my entire world is razed.  i have no purpose, and nothing i am looking forward to.  i have lost all passion and will to live.  i cannot go on, and i do not want to.  i do not want what is left, and i do not want to rebuild.  i am not interested in the unknown opportunities, the past is going to haunt me always.  please try to appreciate every moment and every thing, because it will all end at some point in ti ame.

i want you to remember the happy memories we have shared, and not any sad ones.  it is okay to remember the happy ti ames with \[ex-wife\] too.  she was so great, and good to me.  but i gave too much of my life to her, i trusted her forever, and i did not realize what i had until she was gone - my biggest regret.  i tried to convince myself i did not love her, but i did, so much, and i still do.  i am sorry i lost her to you as well.  and i am sorry for any embarrassment you feel as a result of this.

i am sorry about the loose ends, but at least i was able to leave you some money.  trust me, i know you would still want me here instead, but i am happy i can leave you with something.  please have 15% go to mom and dad, and 42.5% each to \[brothers\].  i just decided to split it this way based on need.  i love you all equally, truly.  more than you know.  i am sorry i did not say and show it more.  any related expenses to come off the top.  i hope this makes your lives a little easier in ti ame.  i do not know how much it will be, but do not feel guilty to do whatever you want with it.  i wanted you to have this, and i want you to enjoy your lives.

my passing was peaceful and painless.  i drank pentobarbital.  i did not do it because it was easy.  i did it because my life is too hard, my reality too harsh, my future too gri am, and my past too good.  please have me cremated, and i do not want my ashes in an uright now or my name engraved anywhere.  sprinkle some in an herb plant if you wish, like \[aunt\].  feel free to have a celebration of life at home with the extended family when you are okay to do so.  i know it is going to be sad, but i hope there are laughs and love too.

i love you all, i am sorry that i let you down.  i did this for me, i am not staying here for anyone else.  please do not think of me as selfish, i just know my life is over.  you could not have saved me, i did this to myself, and i am going on my terms now.  i feel terrible about the pain i am leaving you with, but i do not want to suffer anymore.  every single day has been a struggle.  i am sorry for making your lives harder, i really hate that part because i love you all so much.  and you are allowed to feel whatever emotions you want towards me, even anger.  i understand.  but know i have already accepted your eventual forgiveness into my heart.  i hope this can bring you all closer.  life is short, and i do not want you to spend more ti ame than you have to dwelling in sadness.  i want you to be strong for each other.  one of us had to die first, i am sorry it was me.

please know i am at peace with my end.  if there is an afterlife, i will be seeing you in ti ame.  i hope there is, but i am okay if there is not too.  i have had my fun here, now it is ti ame for me to go.

27,"looking to semi permanently close this doorway to add a soundproofing barrier to the doorway and the back of the closet. the rest of the wall that is not pictured has a much thicker wall made of plaster (1909 house) so should not be as much of a problem. 

i am in a rental but am also a professional painter. landlord keeps rent low so i have painted all three bedrooms for hi am both for free, as well as because this is where i am raising my baby and want the paint to stay on the wall (it was chipping off).
     that to say, i have pretty free rein to do stuff, and i will also likely need to dismantle it and do some repairs when i move out some years from now. when i moved in, landlord had great stuff foam sealing the doorway closed. 

so, cut to fit soundboard? what is the best way to attach that? any other options? whatever it takes to dismantle this, i will not have a problem doing the repairs necessary to put things back together. au pair will be here one year with both parties having the option to extend it to two years. we will almost certainly have an au pair living there a mini amum of two years even if we do not extend this particular person. strong possibility of several years of an au pair living in this room. small possibility that the landlord wont make me dismantle the doorway soundproofing when i move out. high possibility that the back of the closet sound proofing will be permanent.

use case here is that through the doorway is the nursery with the baby. picture is taken from the bedroom that is to be the au pair's room (starting next month). she has another door and we want her room to be a retreat for her from the rest of the house, not for her to have to hear the baby crying when she is off duty. we get 45 hours a week of child care, which is great, but also means she has 123 total hours to herself per week (including sleeping, etc), and we do not want the baby crying to wake her up cause that is not when she will be on duty.

58,"just some nonsensehey there. 23, almost 24. male. possibly bipolar, definitely depressed about 90% of the ti ame these days. it is not just the slow, slogging miserable type of depression either; it is quite often, in fact more often than not, day-to-day mood swings, and if not that, then complete and utter emotional emptiness. i think about death and dying a lot, and wonder what my death will be like. i think about suicide, but have not really actually considered it in years. 

bipolar disorder runs in my family, and i have experienced symptoms of it, so while i do not think i have the right to diagnose myself, the evidence is there. the most strongest of which would be what i think are manic episodes--long, extended periods where i have felt really happy and energetic and like my body and mind are completely in tune with one another, and i can do anything i put my mind to. i have periods like this, and they last just as long as my depressive periods do, i think. they honestly feel great, althoughugh i can get a little over the top with the i ampulsiveness, especially when it comes to spending money. what pains me the most is that i have at multiple ti ames in my life felt both extremes: complete happiness and utter despair. my mind can never stick with one.

i am also in a relationship with a girl who does not seem to understand why or how i feel this way. she is just a generally happy person i guess, and she comes from a good family that is not broken and dysfunctional like mine. i had kind of a rough childhood and adolescence; hers was pretty normal. her friends are pretty normal too, and they all come from very financially well-off families for the most part, so i always feel out of place around them. i feel out of place around her family too, and i am not very good at making conversation with them.

anyway, my girlfriend is upset with me, in many ways rightfully so, because in her eyes i should just be happier, i guess. i admit i can a really negative person, and i complain about a lot of things, and i definitely take it too far at ti ames. i guess it is just how i cope--analyzing and reflecting on everything. but the main kicker is that because of our different backgrounds and upbringings, we have trouble understanding each other. she does not understand why i am depressed, and i do not understand why she just does not ""get it."" i also worry every day that it is not going to work out with her. she is the first girlfriend i have had, and we got along really well for about 4 months but then we started getting into arguments and we just keep fighting and fighting. and i get angry and offended by trivial shit like something her parents said or something one of her friends did or said. anyway, not sure where i am going with this. **tldr:** we argue too much, and i already have anger issues which does not help, and she is also not the type of person who likes to talk about her feelings but i *am* so that difference makes any kind of conversation with her very difficult. i do not know what to do to make any of it better. i am sure i will figure it out thoughugh.

anyway, just thoughught i would share my feelings with reddit. i am sick of feeling dissatisfied. because i am dissatisfied. i am sick of my shitty fast food job. i am sick of my life going nowhere. i am sick of staying in the same town for so long and not connecting with anyone (i am very antisocial--something i have tried to work on, but i backslide constantly), most of all i am sick of my self-destructive anger and constant existential pondering. maybe i need to change some things. get a less stressful job (hard because i am in a full-ti ame management position which allows me to pay my rent and live on my own, but i might have to just give that up for the sake of my mental well-being), be more proactive with my interests (film, television, music, art--like most people here, haha), and also maybe look for some low-cost therapy or counseling of some sort. now that i think about it, i can probably see a counselor at my college and get like free therapy or something. i am going to school so i can be an esl teacher abroad, by the way. that is my current plan, subject to change. but we will see.

rarely laughing 

* i used to laugh at a lot of things, and crack jokes all the ti ame (that were surprisingly, actually funny.) now i just try to seem like a normal person, but it is hard when you have little motivation for anything

lack of personality

* i used to have a bright personality, talking to people all the ti ame, and being a very ecstatic person

being *too* conscious

* back in the day, i went about life not really thinking too much about what people thoughught of me, i just lived life how it went (usually for the good). now all i do is think about the things happening around me, why people are doing what their doing, much deeper topics, and many things that are unnecessary but there. also leads to anxiety

no emotions

* at this point, i do not really have any emotions either, this includes rarely laughing, never being bothered by things that are generally tragic, rarely being genuinely happy from an event

self-destructive behaviour

* procrastination, negative-thoughughts, it all leads to less motivation to do anything, and it is getting worse

the abbess garden story is a mix of history and fiction. it begins in 1643 and occurs in the abbey of port-royal-des-champs in france. this abbey is now a [national museum](https://www.port-royal-des-champs.eu/). the main plot revolves around the legacy of a deceased and very real british spy, [john cecil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_cecil_(priest)), who died in paris in 1626.  
  
nathalie genet-rouffiac is the director and curator of the port-royal-des-champs, but she is also a historian specialising in spies. before joining the museum, she did her phd on the british islands in the 17th century and worked on english and irish nationals in france who were often forced to become spies. she then worked as the head of archives for the wwii spies in france.   
  
i asked her for an interview on real spies of the 17th century. for about 1 hour, we discussed british spies and their relation to this place, gardening history, religious views of the ti ame, etc. you can watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4phsut4x6xq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4phsut4x6xq)

big sam was my friend honestly was my favorite. of course there is the still relevant societal critique on both traditional fundamentalists and inactive bystanders but honestly just the premise of a man who is traveling through space trying to find heaven to get to a lost loved one is a concept i am kind of obsessed with. 

for both eyes of dust and world of the myth i kind of wish he had taken his ti ame a bit more. a story where an i amage obsessed society rots with its own evil after destroying someone they felt was their lesser is kind of amazing but the actual prose were a bit obvious and the story was really rushed. i needed more ti ame to connect to the characters. meanwhile a story that ends with the i amplication that an unlikeable dork, a deplorable rapist, and a woman who has the nerve to lead a man on would all i ammediately kill themselves in despair if they had to face who they really were really needs more ti ame to get me on board with the characters being complex rather than taking for granted the super dated idea that women are just asking for it.

lonelyache and delusions for a dragon slayer are the ones that have me questioning where the character ends and the authoughr begins. lonelyache was so weird and creepy and while i was not as taken by the ""trippy visuals"" so many talk up for delusions (there have been 60 years of trippy visuals depicted since its initial release) its subversion of a swashbuckling fantasy is doing leaps and bounds better than a lot of attempts at genre subversions released today. however i have to rate this story a 0/10 and hold ellison's estate personally liable for the harm inflicted on me with the words ""labial moisture.""

my voice is very, very quiet. even when i am confident and feel like i am being loud i am hard to understand. it is very deep and it is combined with a fairly serious mumbling habit. i barely open my mouth when i talk because i feel like i am making weird faces if i do. seeing pictures or video of myself talking reinforces this.  

when someone gives me that ""wtf did you just say"" look and then just blankly says, yeah, sure, and politely nods, i take a major hit to my confidence. every ti ame i try to be louder and more dominant it keeps happening and i sink lower and lower until i hit rock bottom and have to cli amb back up, only to repeat the cycle over and over again. 

it is not just that i am quiet. as i get more and more discouraged i can feel my body tighten up. my sinuses get completely congested, my tongue feels too big for my mouth, my throat closes in on itself and even when i feel like i am shouting words trickle out of my mouth like a faucet that is just barely on. the more i strain the worse it gets. 

when this starts happening i get incredibly flustered and begin forgetting words. i stumble on what i am saying, get side tracked, say things that do not make sense. i go off on tangents that are totally irrelevent to the topic. words start to slur together like my tongue is numb. people keep asking me to repeat myself and i want to scream in frustration.

by the end of the cycle i am so discouraged that i feel like i would be better off never speaking again. i mull it over in my head and all i can think about it is how badly i embarrass myself when i open my mouth. i get extremely depressed about it and then that depression leaks over into everything else that makes me feel like a failure. 

eventually i start to get over it and work my way back up to feeling normal again, but the first ti ame i mumble something and someone squints and asks me to repeat myself the whole thing starts over. i seriously feel like it is driving me completely crazy. 

it is ruining all of my relationships with my co-workers and my marriage. my co-workers do not understand me most of the ti ame and have all but stopped talking to me unless its completely necessary. my wife continually talks over me and my depression and paranoia start to tell me she is using my problem to take control of arguments, which sends me from the mumbling to all-out screaming in frustration.

when i made it home, i grabbed a snow shovel and started breaking the ice to free the drain. the ice was really stubboright now and i could not see the drain, but i knew that it was there. after a few hours, i decided to call it a day. the next day, i used a saw to saw the ice. still, it did not budge. then i used a pickaxe on the ice. it worked better than the shovel. still, i could not completely break through the metre of ice. i decided to put more road salt on it in a last attempt. after that, i went back inside.

i checked my facebook and there was a post on the community group that said “whoever is the parent of that kid breaking the ice, please get your kid, they are blocking the road.”

where i live, nobody wants to splash a kid with road water, because it is like the bare mini amum of what you can get sued for. so nobody wanted to drive by too fast. they all drove slowly to avoid splashing what they thoughught was somebody's kid. i told the original poster that it was my kid, and asked them to take the picture down. they did take the picture down. i knew i was short, but i did not know that i was that short.

104,"so, i read a lot, like most folks in this subreddit, and i have really tried to read more from authoughrs around the world. i am no linguist, so i am forced to read the english translations of these works, but i have found some interesting patteright nows in world literature that i thoughught i might share. i find that various languages really lend themselves to different types of writing mediums and styles. obviously these are very broad generalizations, just my experience. 

-english is an incredibly vocabulary heavy language, borrowing from virtually every other language at this point. their champion is the novel, to no one's surprise with writers like dickens or austen. english literature tends to be wordy but not verbose, it just usually requires that many words to adequately describe what you are referring to. english novels tend to be morally driven, as opposed to character or plot driven. 

 -more than english, i think the novel is really best expressed through indian and russian literature. tamil is believed to have the largest vocabulary of any language, but more than that both russia and india have incredibly rich folklore backgrounds. both cultures prize plot over other elements of the book, and both culture's works frequently have casts in the hundreds. for me, and indian novel is always full of high drama and tragedy, withoughut falling into being goofy. russian literature, especially tolstoy, is often same, with others like dostoevsky or turgenev being more inward facing. the one real split between these two is that the russians tend to write philosophically more than the indians. 

-french literature is (as is almost stereotypically french) emotional. hugo, proust, dumas, etc. all cut to your heart and beg you for a passionate experience. plot comes secondarily but organically to the relationships between characters. french literature speaks to your heart. 

-korean literature is, to me, akin to the historic differences between film and television. while the latter evolved from radio and storytelling, the former was derived from photography and was about striking visuals. korean literature will never say 10 words when 1 would suffice. korean books tend to be very short but evocative, creating an ambiance that you live in rather than a plot that you pursue. it is very peaceful and often very melancholic. 

-japanese literature is both si amilar to korean and completely different. the japanese focus more on plot and often have significantly larger novels, but compared with westeright now literature it is still not what i would consider plot driven. instead, japanese literature meanders, taking the reader where it chooses in a zig zag, loop de loop path that can often be hard to follow. there is no 3 act structure, but that is not to say that japanese literature is lost, only that you may feel lost while in it. it still resolves and you see that every detail was almost always planned from the start. 

-irish literature tends to be short and playful. rules get thrown out of the window. joyce is of course the poster child for irish writing, but beckett or toibin also play with form and give you shocking experiences withoughut you having realized. with irish writing i would not say plot or characters are the pri amary goals, but rather the story is. irish writing always feels as thoughugh someone is sitting in front of you telling you a story, one you cannot always follow, but one they insist upon. i love it. 

again, these are broad strokes and only a few cultures are discussed. i am curious what others think thoughugh and what other si amilar patteright nows can be found in other cultures' works. ",noise,noise data,0.95

118,"feeling low, have thoughught about ending iti am new here and given my useright nowame you can tell i want this to be anonymous, i want to be able to get my emotions out there withoughut strings attached.
recently i went through alot that got me to think about killing myself but there is alot more to my history that really only makes what has happened all the more painful. hope it is not a bother, i am sure others have been through alot more.
i want to be clear but not make this a novel so if anyone is willing to read this and needs/wants clarification i will try to provide as best as i can: i was molested when i was a little kid, it was a one ti ame incident but it screwed me up royally once i remembered(i had repressed the memory). in addition to that i am on the higher end of the spectrum, which only made school an absolute shit show. combine the two, with me remembering at the end of middle school, and suicide had been at the front of my mind for years. i was able to fight it for awhile, eventually made more friends and revealed to some of them what happened with a surprising amount of support. slowly i was able to put my suicidal thoughughts in the backseat of my head and move foward, trying to figure out a career that will allow me to help people(really in anyway, try to make some days brighter for others in a way i did not for years).
so why am i here?
my friend introduced me to someone else, we will call them h, h is someone who has been in an abusive home, has substance abuse problems and a huge problem with opening up to people. my friend figured i could help them. to a degree i did-they became more outgoing in regards to being emotionally honest, being more accepting to therapy(something they had been going through but experiencing doubts about)and even went to get help with the substance abuse. we became fast friends.
what recently happened was that someone h knows told them that i had abused someone at a party while in high school. this abuse mentioned is a clai am that i sexually assaulted someone by trying to grab them. i did not. the very thoughught of abuse of any kind, that especially, makes me sick. h has cut ties with me, someone i came to care about has come to see me as something that i am not. something disgusting. with h being someone i care about and having had, i will admit, helped me by giving me someone who i could help...it got me thinking about ending it all(i would say how/my idea of how i would do it but i do not want to risk being explicit)i talked to my best friend today about it, they encouraged me to try my best to move on and seek therapy(my friends have all tried to nudge me towards seeking professional help for years but i have just never gone). my best friend got me through the day but i am so fucking distraught and while i do not think i will ulti amately go that way...having the suicidal thoughughts pop up to the front of my head again is a really bad sign and i do not know how good my judgement will be in the next couple of days. what should i do? how should i cope with this?

like most of the great american generals, he went to westpoint, but he sucked at it. he failed mathematics in his first year and had to repeat the whole year.

in the interwar period, he submitted a plan to the army to make tankmen wear golden football helmets and what was essentially boy scout uniforms. it was regected.

in italy, patton slapped two of his soldiers with ptsd. the event was controversial and caused hi am to be relieved of command and he was used as a decoy commander up until after the invasion of france.

124,"advice on self-care/hygiene when depressedit may be useful to state the i am a black woman to address this specific hygiene issue, since for others it may be handled a little differently. 

anyway, i am a recent college graduate. i have been working the same temp office position for almost two years. however, i realize that i need to find a different job to support myself and to have benefits. it is just been difficult for the past three months. 

and recently my mother told me that she is been sick and that it may be breast cancer. so i am conceright nowed about her and my ability to support her. 

my hygiene has been up and down over the past three months. i have gotten a handle on most of everything except for my hair. usually my hair could take between three and six hours to get done, depending on various factors. if you mess up a style you have to start all over generally. so i tend to stick with braids to make things easier on myself. i tried to si amplify my routine recently and i have had trouble keeping up with it. so now it is been several weeks since i have refreshed my hair and i know it needs to get done, even if it does not exactly look that appealing. 

i have considered just cutting it so it is no longer a factor in my routine. however, i may not like the end result and others may find me less appealing and more masculine, and that may not bode well for familial relations or job hunting. 

so any advice would be helpful. i think things are getting better. likely i am just going to have to muscle through until i find a suitable daily routine.

i am a happy, productive, well liked (far as i can tell) person, but i have been having flashes of suicidal thoughughts lately, more and more progressively over the last 2 years. when i say flashes, what i mean is this... i will be going about my day, and my mind will wander to something i did earlier. maybe 2 minuets ago, earlier that day, last month, whenever. i think about something embarrassing or regretful, like forgetting someones name, saying something stupid on a date, over sharing personal life to co-workers, forgetting to tip, worrying about whether i would insulted someone, etc. regular social faux pas and or personal gaffs we all make. and i ammediately my first thoughugh will be... i should kill myself. usually shooting myself, something quick. and then i catch myself, and think “why the fuck am i thinking about killing myself. why is that my first thoughught, upon remembering some comment i made that got misinterpreted, to kill myself?”

i never think beyond that. i never contemplate suicide. like what i would put in the letter, how i would do it, who would be sad, when, where, etc. it is just this flash of “... that was embarrassing/myopic/petty.....” and then i amagine just offing myself.

it has been happening more and more lately and it is starting to freak me out. i would never actually do it. i am reasonably happy 25 year old dude. i am decent looking, healthy, have lots of friends, a day job that i kinda like and pays well, and am even a semi-professional stand up comic, which gives me i ammense creative fulfilment and a hell of an ego boost. i have not been laid in a few months, but i get a decent amount of attention from women, all things considered.

but then randomly, more and more recently, my reaction to petty social anxieties and small, but poor, decisions i have made is to want to wrap my mouth around a gun. again, i am not suicidal in the traditional sense, i would not, and definitely could not, follow through with it, and that is why i find it so strange that i have these thoughughts.

has anyone else had this experience? i know the side bar says not to diagnose, but if there is a name or condition for this i would love resources.

172,"relationships can be the most rewarding experiences, but they also teach us valuable lessons about self-respect and emotional boundaries. one thing i have learight nowed is that the more you allow disrespect, the more it becomes a patteright now. people often do not realize how much they can take until you set a li amit. never be afraid to walk away when your peace is at stake.

no matter how loyal or loving you are, remember, respect is mutual. you deserve someone who values you from the start, not someone you constantly have to prove your worth to. and if change is not something they are willing to make, it is okay to let go. we cannot change others; we can only choose who we allow in our lives.

i have been depressed since the 6th grade, moving schools and having to deal with being the fat kid was hard and in 7th grade i almost committed suicide 3 ti ames and if it were not for my best friend i probably would not be here anymore. since then my depression was getting better, by my senior year in high school i started to feel better about myself and felt like i had my life together, i was still depressed but definitely better then i had ever been in a long ti ame. i was going to college, i was running on a varsity cross country team and i finally felt like i knew what i was doing.

turight nows out that i hated that school. i was drinking all the ti ame, i started to hate running and i stayed in my dorm almost 24/7. i did not know if i wanted to major in that subject anymore and i felt like i was wasting money and ti ame. my depression was almost at an all ti ame low and i hated myself and my life. 

fast forward a couple months and i am transferred to a new college and commute to school almost everyday. i got a part ti ame job on the weekends, i am able to hangout with my best friend more, and i met a girl.

within the same week, she got fired from her job for being sick too much, and she totaled her car (thankfully she was not hurt). on top of that, her family is unwise with money, and as a result, do not have a lot. she does not get good financial aid and has not been able to go to college full ti ame in her 3 years of going. all of it is paid by loans. her mom is completely on and off and is always on her back. it is hard for her to find a job because their entire family has one car to share, and despite applying to 30+ places, only one has called her back, and she was not hired.

when we are together, she is happy most of the ti ame. but when we are not, she can get very down as she is subject to having to do everything her mom and older sister tells her to, and she has no say in the matter. she has very little control over her life, as she is pretty much trapped when i am not around.

i do not want to be completely negative; i am not naïve enough to think that everything is awful. my biggest achievement i have done so far is that i have finished college and started work as a registered nurse. was going through orientation just fine, and then covid hit. they hurried us new grads along and so now, i have started my career helping take care of the icu covid patients. i am actively contributing working towards ending this pandemic by helping these people and that does make me happy. no matter how insignificant i might feel, my actions are helping someone and their family at least somewhat. this is something unique that i am doing that i can say not many other people are doing.

but work can only grant me so much happiness and purpose. i do not have any constant friends or anyone to talk to in my day-to-day life. everything and everyone i do have is digital; i have basically zero other human contact outside work. the only people i really see are the other people working out when i am outside running. and i am not talking to anyone, i am just running past them with music in my ears. could i stroke up a conversation? possibly. but no one is here to talk - just exercise. 

obviously all this alone ti ame could be blamed on the virus, but even before i was not much of a sociable person, go figure. i do not and did not really go out much or go to restaurants - it is cheaper and healthier for me to cook and drink at home. besides, i would not have anyone to go with and i do not want to go to a bar alone. i would look so pathetic. relationship status is nonexistent as well. no one wants to do anything during a pandemic. and even if i get matches, i cannot keep a conversation going. people fall out; schedules do not add up for dates, etc. is it me? is it them? i have deleted and redownloaded tinder so many ti ames at this point thinking it will be a different experience each ti ame. i feel like i need to be at least trying thoughugh, so that is why i keep it around. i would be down to meet people at a bar, but i do not have the confidence to talk to women. i need a wingman or something, not just myself. 

i do not know. i have been alone with my thoughughts my entire life. i told myself back in college that if i was still feeling this way when i turight nowed 25, that it was alright to go ahead and get it over with and just kill myself. it is inevitable anyway. living this long seemed like a suitable enough ti ame to test the waters and see what it was like when i was finally finished with school and on my own... news flash, it sucks, it really does. 

i *desperately* want human connection, romantic or just otherwise friendly. i want someplace to go to on the weekends with a group of friends that we could all enjoy. i want something as si ample as a hobby shared with other people that i could do together. i have tried club apps and meetup events in my city for the things that i enjoy - hiking/camping, fishing, reading. nothing. especially with covid. i want to become more spontaneous and less stingy with my money and learight now to have more fun doing things. but i am afraid i am going to waste it all. i am so hopelessly, disgustingly alone and all i want to do is just go to sleep forever and just say i had a good run and none of this was for me. i am exhausted. i go to work and i come home. there is no in between. i cannot do this for the rest of my life; i will go insane.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

(you can skip the following part since it is a shitload of everything that turight nowed to me this spot where i am now.)

**my past**

i never were positive minded, i went through many stuff that already made me realize in my early teens that i have huge struggles with my own way of seeing the world. it started with anxiety issues for several stuff but actually my first loves got me to a psychological state that i really seeked to die already around 14/15.
people told me its just a phase, general puberty stuff. so i tried to deal with my personal problems, tried to live like everyone in my age back then, finished school and started higher school.
there i met my ""real"" first love, because it lasted for the long relationship i have ever head. but it started to get down until we realized that we probably will be physical separated once we finished high school. she turight nowed into an abusive girl, that fucked my mind up by every chance for every reason. i had selfharming tendencies, broke my own fist by punching at walls during heated discussions with her, she got to some mental phases where i would rather die.
so the ti ame came, i started going to university, only could see her once or twice per week and i realized she is cheating on me with my best friend. i was at the lowest point in my life, for weeks. everyday i hated myself for losing her, even thoughugh she abused me mentally for months before. i started blaming myself because i took this dual degree at the university, but it was my only chance for getting well-paid and safe somewhen in the future even thoughugh the job itself is annoying.
i switched between sleepless nights and crying by every chance where i was alone over the loss of her, yet i started to learight now and learight now for best results during my first term in university. it worked out, but the wounds and self-harm remained. i got into drugs, experienced the first perfect moments in my life since i lost her. i keep drowning myself in my leisure ti ame in playing a particular video game, or trying other drugs. one stayed, and still is my at least weekly follower since 3 years now.

the university got worse, i got worse because i still hated myself and that study itself. nothing could fill the emptiness that slowly killed my motivation so i ended up for the whole years of my study in a permanent ""fear"" of losing the only thing that was kind-of well promised for my future. yet i couldnt made it properly, dropping stuff, the need of repeating exams.
my drug abuse turight nowed from a great experience in a si amply ""just get high"" to feel numb. numb of everything. my common sense kind of made me still trying and finish with so many phases of mental weight downs the study.
i graduated in the end of august this year. the work i got into turight nowed out to be somethingelse than expected, just something i cannot do by myself so i fell during last month in another hole all over again.
3 years of a integrated degree programm that i did not like at all in and enviroment of people i hated so much in a daily life of nothing but waiting for free ti ame to stick to this game or wait for free days to do drugs. and now the well promised career entry that i cannot managed. i just cannot quit it since i would end up in a big loan of paying back all the college tuitions to my employer.
now i requested another career entry, far away from home where i just know an somewhat online-friend. i work 'til friday at my ""old"" work and have to start next week at my ""new"" one.

i barely managed to find a rental apartment, but only at november, so i have to live by that friend til there. 

**where am i now**
i doubt everything. i doubt it will turight now out as a really better work, so i also have to move away from my environment in a capital city just to earight now money that i do not need in a job i do not like. but its safe..and well paid..everything i always got flustered back then i should get an proper education. i just do what i am supposed to do, what everything always expected of me. 

i see nothing anymore. i always seeked out for my graduation, to maybe finally have a more peaceful life withoughut the urge to numb my mental pain. but it will not stop.
it will never stop. is one shit barly gone, the next is waiting around the coright nower. i do not know why i am doing this besides my common sense of living a independent, financial safe life.

but for what? 
i never found a compareable person/relationship since i lost my longest relationship and i do not think it will come in the future. nothing makes me happy, no matter what i do, even if i force my self to go out, it just feels worse than getting high or sticking at home. i hate myself, i hate my whole way of seeing my daily life since i know other people would be happy about a more or less secured life. but i cannot. 
since years i always wished to die, and now after i had my worst three years in my life i couldnt i amagine any better than not waking up anymore every night i go sleep. yet my survival instincts just never turight nowed me dead, only quite close to (over dosage, toxic mixes of different drugs etc.).
if i wouldnt know that i am precious for my family, i guess i would have ended up killing myself already. but now when i move far away from everyone, i do not know if i can keep this up.
i hate my life. my own mind, thoughse voices inside my head will never stop and only wait for every chance to turight now me in this dark cycle of depression every day. no matter to whom i talk, no matter how many ti ames i try to take help, it does not change anything. i just life because i am supposed to withoughut any purpose. a endless pain, no matter what circumstances because i could not i amagine anything makes me happy.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.90

206,"trying to move on/grow up by moving out, looking for advice (its relevant and explained in the post).i have adhd (or most of the symptoms) and depression, most likely developed over the years from exclusion and bullying back in middle and high school.  i will not go into all that thoughugh.

i am 21. i still live at home. its normally not a big deal.  lots of kids do this.  i am not trying to move out because of that.  i am trying to move out because i keep making the same mistakes over and over.  mostly lying.  and manipulation (through pity thoughugh i have managed to curb this i ammensely).  they are not small lies.  not white lies.  they are huge ones. i put a heck of a lot of effort into them.  fake emails, fake checks, faking mileage.  and its usually because i want to avoid confrontation with my parents.  they have every right to be angry at me.  i just for some reason like to push that off even if it makes it 10x worse.

anyways, i have tried a heck of a lot of things. therapists. psychologists.   the depression i have managed to mostly keep in check (with bupropion.  and vyvanse.  ). 
i am still working on my motivational issues, tend not to finish things or wait too long.  

i just think i need to grow up.  i only went to a 'real' college for one year so the living on your own thing did not really stick.  currently starting community college after a 2 year gap. but i digress.  i have been home since 19.  going on 3 years.  my point here is i am still in 'childhood' mindset.  i used to hide from the world in high school in my room with books or playing video games alone (not many friends).  its like i never stopped now.  to some degree.  i do get out more, i am a volunteer firefighter, i go to school now, made a few friends at my old job.  ex job i should say.  but i do not want to do anything. i just want everything to stay the same.  not have any responsibilities. 

i should not say i do not want thoughse things. its that being home i am in my comfort zone.  i should state my town is very well off. people always have said our town is a bubble because its nothing like the real world.  i agree. i do not know what its like to struggle for rent. or go hungry. i take these things for granted. mostly.  so essentially i am 'content' and have no drive to get out.

i think what i am trying to say is my home is a toxic environment for me.  no its not an abusive home. not dealing with divorced parents. but i cannot seem to change my ways and the only thing i have not changed (as in something i have tried to try and get motivated or whatever) is where i live.  i do not know if that is crazy or not thoughugh.  

i guess i am almost stating i need a reality check.  because my parents are on the verge of kicking me out.  i want to leave and live on my own. have my own freedoms (it frustrates me that i am still living under teenage year rules. kind of.  like going to bed by 11 30,.  its not that i 'have to'. its because my parents get annoyed about noise i make late at night.  that is just one example.  ).  and what frustrates me the most is my parents do not get me.  they have no idea why i am acting this way. they do not understand why i do not want to do my best.  my dads very smart.  he achieves.  i do not.  i am not dumb either.  i realize its a waste of potential. but that is what depression is.and does.

i apologize for the extremely long novel.  i am doing this on my phone, which you would think i would make it shorter.  i usually am better on a full keyboard at conveying in precise statements.  anyways any clarifications do not hesitate to ask.

my tl;dr/question:  i am trying to move out. living at home is not healthy for me anymore i feel. so i am asking if this is a good idea.  i am not going to be able to for months.  need a job first obviously (got fired for something stupid and my fault).  and any pointers on moving out.  i cannot go far still enrolled in college.  and i will need a car too so more money to save.  

thanks.  i need a reality check.  ",depression,depression,0.90

214,"something my therapist told me that actually helped. hope it helps someone else on here.  i think one of the most eye-opening and painful things that has come out of my depression is finding that most of my friends have run out on me when now is the ti ame that i need them most. the people i can still call real friends i can now count on one hand. this might seem like something i should have realized by now, and i might have been naive for thinking otherwise, but before i grew up in a smaller town, so it was not uncommon to have more than a few close friends, and i was fairly good at maintaining and nurturing friendships. 

anyway, one of the worst parts about being depressed was struggling with understanding why everyone seemed to be ""too busy"" for me, despite how sick i was. coping with the fact that most of my friends were ignoring me, or ignoring this part of me. trying to swallow the awful feelings that came with having people turight now their back on me as soon as things got rough in my life. and i think this whole process was prolonged because i still kept hope that maybe they would come to their senses and realize that i needed them, that i needed comfort, and that they would come back and be there for me, help me, as i had always done for them. forgive me if this sounds arrogant, but the only thing i have ever been able to say i am good at, is being a friend. i now see that placing the same expectations on others that i hold myself to is just setting myself up for disappointment. and the problem was, this hope that they would realize how much they were hurting me, these high expectations that i could not drop, was just making the pain worse. 

then this past weekend, my therapist said something that woke me up. he told me, many ti ames, people who are depressed think that because they are sick and hurting and crying out, someone will come along and notice their pain and stop to help. he told me that so many depressed people wait every day for someone to come along to save them, but the truth is, rarely does that ever happen, and that the best thing to do was to learight now how to attend to myself and be comfortable with being alone. he said the best thing was to never need anyone. and i think being told so straightforwardly that it is a long shot that anyone will come by to help me was what i needed. no more having to sit around and hold on to the hope that it will be otherwise. 

fuck everyone else. i will do it myself. it will be one hell of a fight, but if i make it and cli amb out of this hole, i will go find new friends. i feel so fucking bitter right now but it sure as hell feels more invigorating than feeling that deep, profound void that depression is. i will use this energy as motivation for now. i do not know if hearing this will help any of you on here, but it helped me just a bit, definitely more than anything else has in the past 6 months i have been in therapy. for any of you out there that feel alone because everyone has abandoned you, just know it is not you that is the problem. fuck 'em. when you get better, they will regret not sticking around. anyone on here needing to talk, please pm me, because god knows i need someone to talk to and maybe you do too. we could help each other. :) ",depression,depression,0.95

i spend all my ti ame alone and with nothing to do. it is really grating on me. i do not know anyone. i have slowly stopped talking to all my friends (loosely used) from high school because they all do not respond to me, and i am always the one that has to initiate contact, put all the effort in. plus, i do not really want to see them anymore. if i think about what they are doing now it is pretty depressing. i have outgrown them, and probably harbor some resentment or them being such poor friends.

i have made no friends in college. there is no on that i can just text and ask, ""hey, what are you doing."" i feel awkward going places alone. i used to go out to eat just because i hoped i might meet someone. it never happened in hundreds of tries. 

in high school i never joined any clubs, played any sports, because i did not want to be around people. i always had this feeling that i was unwanted. i had nothing to build upon into my college years.

i did join a club once. by the end of it no one had talked to me, and i could not tell you a single persons name.

i am just trying to drive home the point that i have no one to do anything with. go to a bar? yeah, i have done that with roommates. i sure love standing awkwardly doing nothing for a couple of hours, feeling like i should not be there. but if i did it alone, then i could feel really out of place.

i actually have an online profile. have messaged over 100 girls at this point. nothing.

it is hard to admit you are an ugly person, but i am. do you guys know chatroulette/omegle video chat? everyone passes me right away. it is kind of heartbreaking. i have never had a girlfriend.

i think i am saying that not only am i completely alone right now, but i do not really have any hope to escape it. i do not know what to do with myself. i would welcome suggestions.

the ideas i do come up with i cannot follow through on. eat better, work out, get ahead in my studies. i have no drive. i have no energy. i fail at it all. and so i end up not wanting to get up in the moright nowing. wishing i could sleep all day when i do not have work. i am alone in my room (which i cannot keep clean despite having nothing better to do) 80%+ of the ti ame i am not working.

219,"i am 21, i am told i have my life ahead of me but i already feel dead.ok, backstory ti ame i guess. sorry for the wall of text i will break it up. this post is really just for me to have a reference of everything that is happened. if you want to read a depressing  short novel be my guest. if you want to ask questions or comment go ahead i am not sure when i will get back to this. 

i passed highschool wanting to go into art or graphic design. i went into a one year art certificate program only to realize i am mediocre in comparison to the average, and failed because i easily become depressed and lack motivation, on top of a two hour commute and late hours and a job. i hid the fact i failed because i had just gotten comfortable in my job and was given full ti ame summer hours so i told myself i could somehow pay it off and do something else before my parents found out. instead i spent all my ti ame at work or getting high (just now starting to experi ament), and ended up spending all my money on drugs and gas. 

so of course my parents find out and do thier usual bitch fit about how i have to finish school and i have to have a college education, so they pretty much force me into taking a business course at a closer school because they have thier own agenda. my loans are deferred if i am currently in school, and my parents have work benefits that only apply to me if i am in school.

i had absolutely no motivation going into this course and it only got worse once i realized i was the minority on the campus. the majority (and i mean 80%) of students are from india, and like they still have a caste system only talk in thier language and cheat all the ti ame. i was in a course i did not care about with people from another country who will not associate with me. try not failing a course when you have no-one to talk to or do work together.

so of course i literally just gave up and stopped going to class. i spent my ti ame getting high and spending the rest of my work money. so of course work turight nows south. 

i work in the largest recreation center in the city, and they hold themselves to a high standard (while paying me mini amum wage). i became the person everyone shit on because i am antisocial and not very talkative. people began talking behind my back and one day i had came in late, someone made up a story that while rushing i punched the fridge in the staff room. i was i ammedtiately dismissed from work with no evidence or recourse from the accuser (who they never diclosed). they were more conceright nowed with preserving thier i amage rather then treating me like a person. after a few weeks and having to go to meetings with my managers they decided to want to move me to another building farther away even thoughugh my parents decided they wanted to move. so i just stopped answering thier calls and dropped off the map as it were. no-one knew where i went or what i did, not like they cared. i still get recurring thoughughts of strangling my boss for taking away the one escape i had of work.

so now i am out of a job, hiding the fact i failed school and unsure when i am supposed to be moving to somewhere new. 
i figure, fuck it. i am just going to use up the rest of my money and kill myself.

i spend the next few weeks getting completely shitfaced during the day and avoiding my parents when they come home. i had never bonded with my dad after my teenage years and come home one day to find he is bought another motorcycle, our only shared passion. he already had two and this one looked like shit in comparison but he had bought it for me. i felt terrible but i could not even show why. i spent the next few weeks getting it running having no mechanical experience, and once i did, i figured i payed my debt for being a shit son and ran away just before they got home and left a note saying what had happened and that i was a complete failure. 


my dad called the cops to come search for me and they found me when i was on my way back to the house after i had spoken to a friend. these fucking hired thugs said to me that once they find me they ""have"" to bring me back home so if i try to walk away from them it gives them the right to assault me and throw me in a cop car. so of course i comply. i get back to my house to see 3 (4 including the one i was riding in) cop cars in front of my house. great fucking use of tax money right there. one cop looking and five sitting around the house doing fuck all. my dad even let them search my room to find my ""phone bill"" so they could ping my phone (what a nice police state we live in). too bad i have online billing and no drugs for them to find.

they asked me if i was okay to stay home and i said i was not sure, which is the same as saying no so they were again ""obligated"" to bring me to the hospital for evaluation. having to ride handcuffed in a cop car for suicide with everyone trying to look in on you is the most frustrating feeling in the world. once i got to the hospital i had to be escorted through each area by two cops, which made me look like i was a serial killer. 

in a waiting room i was sitting with 5 cops and another handcuffed man who appeared drunk and on coke and he would not stop talking. i was not paying attention until he mentioned that at least he is honest, it is the silent one over there with no cuffs on you should worry about (meaning me). a few of the cops smirked and looked over, i smiled and said he is right. which made them all laugh and broke the tension.

&gt;&gt;&gt;edit: i forgot to mention i cut myself a tattoo, since i figured i would not have it long anyways. it is faded away now, and i still wish it was more visible. (i managed to convince cops it was ink on needlepoint and not cuts)  http://grey600.deviantart.com/art/tron-tattoo-289040163?q=gallery%3agrey600&amp;qo=0

(this next part is a rant i wrote on fb i am just copy pasting because i am lazy)
i follow what they told me to go to college right out of high school because i ""needed"" to, that it is not a choice.
and when i fail it is my fault that i ""chose"" to go.
i say i want to work, to figure things out. well that is not fucking good enough you need to go finish school so you better fucking pick something quick before admissions are over.
alright then, i have just take some business course i did not even want to do because you pushed me to do it.
guess what? i fucking fail because i have no motivation, i get no communication because everyone in my class is a fucking racist high class paki who cheats and steals because when you speak another language you get away with it.

well that is no fucking excuse you ""chose"" to go even thoughugh you said you wanted to work.
guess what? your dad has some connection where he works so that is how you work. and when they all turight now on you for being different you lose your job because other people talk shit about you.

great. i am depressed. in debt. followed everything i was told and i am a fucking waste of space.
well guess  what. i am just going to let my bank account drop  to zero then i am going to run away and kill myself so you fucking assholes learight now your lesson.

oh now that i want to die your all conceright nowed and sorry that i did everything you fucking told me to do. fuck you.

i go get admitted, yet again, by referral. spend a few days there wasting my  ti ame only to have to stay there a few weeks because this fucking paki doctor keeps threatening me with a mental prison sentence if i try to dishcarge myself. fuck you bitch. i would have fucking punched you in the face if my fucking freedom did not depend on it.
so i stay there for three fucking weeks. only to spend the next three fucking months waiting for a referral to some ""help"" program. guess who fucked up the refferal? the same fucking paki threatening me! the system is a fucking joke. now i wanna go back and punch her in her fucking lying throat.

yay i get to go to some ""help"" program and waste another two fucking months there being told i have to take medication and i have to accept thier teachings like it is the fucking bible of mental health. 


at this point it is been almost 6 months since i ran away, and my parents are selling the house. i pretty much thier slave packing everything and prepping everything for the move. during one evening i decide i want to go out on a drive and smoke weed. 

so i smoke and start driving around, only to come to a police car blocking the road. they stop me and say they smell weed and if i just hand it over they will let me go (surprise surprise cops lie). they just use that as an excuse for probable cause so they can search the car even thoughugh i just fucking handed them what i had. so the put me under arrest and search the car. after looking back i know they were sitting there looking for someone else and i just happened to be in wrong place wrong ti ame, not like they gave a shit i was a free quota point. they search the car and take down personal info. another cop comes and asked me all this random shit like if i have a job and where i go to school. i just told hi am straight up i failed school and do not have a job and i was just in the hospital for suicide. he did not give one shit he was just looking for information. they started quesitoning me how i got the weed and what i was doing there i just made up some bullshit on the spot how i walked up to some random and got it and that i do not have any friends. they finally get thier head out of thier asses and ""let me leave"". 

so now i am unsure as to what really happened. am i charged with anything? yeah, possession probably. so now i have a cri aminal record, no job, in debt, no school, about to move.

i feel even worse then i did before. now i really just want to kill myself. i cannot get to sleep at night. i always play out the situation over and over like i could have done anything differently (yeah not be a fucking dumbass and drive around with weed ai amlessly).

i never told anyone what happened but i am shit out of luck if i have to get a background check looking for a job. 

so my parents finally buy a house in the end of september and we move to another city just before winter. i really have no motivation for anything and i am in a new place with no friends or work and no real way to travel so i am stuck in the house. 

i am really just left to my own devices which is never good because i do nothing but get drunk and apply for jobs. 

it is been three months coming on four now since i moved. i have not met anybody, no job, no life. i really do not feel like myself, or a person anymore. i just feel like a ghost.

it always pissed me off that the psychiatrists and professionals i saw were all over 50 and all kept referring to how much ti ame i have, and how i still have my life ahead of me. what is the point? yeah, i have my whole life to be even more of a failure and never get anywhere in life. my old friends from high school are finishing college and have cars and living by themselves and i feel like i have not changed at all. 

at this point i am just waiting out to see if something will happen. all i have to look forward to is getting a mini amum wage job alongside teenagers who are better off then me.

all i can think about is how i was actually happy as a teenager and how i had something to live for. 

now the only reason i do not kill myself is because my parents, and the fact i do not want to kill myself, i just hate my life. 
there are people worse off then me who do not have parents, or people that care and want them, but it is gotten to the point where i just do not want to live anymore. i missed my chance during my teen years and now that it is gone the rest of my life has turight nowed to shit. just to get back where i was 4 years ago i would have to spend another 4 years. i will be 30 before i have anything to call my own. i will be over thirty before i will have a decent job, or be able to move out, or be self sufficient. 



just think about the fact that my 20's are over before they even start makes me want to cry. i am 21 and feel like i am a trapped, i feel like i am in a hole i cannot dig out of. i could get a job and go back to school but big whoop dee shit i will probably fail again or if i do finally manage to get a diploma or degree i will just be in debt on the job search again, not better off then before, just with a $40,000 peice of paper to my name with a cri aminal record.

21, knowing i will not be better off when i am 30. i know it is just rambling now but how the fuck am i supposed to feel? because i feel dead.

227,"i do not feel like trying anymore.i do not know what i am doing with myself anymore. my life is slowly falling apart around me. i moved to a different state a year and a half ago for work. i thoughught so much that this was going to be the start of some change for the better. as months passed on, i became worse and worse. i stopped caring about things. i stopped taking calls from my parents. i hid away and did not want to see anyone or anything. at the same ti ame, i hid how i felt from everyone. i may have given hints or told half truths, but never was able to outright say how i really felt. it was a dull existence of eat, sleep, work.  

about four monts ago, i decided that i should quit in hopes of trying to cli amb out of the hole i had found myself in. i wanted to turight now my life around. i wanted to not become an emotionless robot, going through the motions each day and not living life. for a short ti ame, i started talking to my parents again. i started feeling a little better about life. but that did not last long. the first month after quitting was mostly positive. i was thinking that i would be fine, that things would turight now out for the better. i cannot say i was every really happy, but it was at least better than when i was working at my spirit destroying job. again, that was four months ago.  

as more ti ame passed, i started to sink into that hole of depression once again. i started eating less. i was staying up later and later into the night and into the moright nowing. i have hardly been leaving my apartment. i have no friends in the area and few that i still talk to online. i have slowly stopped answering my phone; stopped answering calls from my family. i have slowly stopped applying to jobs because i am being sent deeper into this hole with each rejection email and each instance of terminated communication. i have slowly stopped trying in life.  

now, up to today, i have not felt this bad in a long ti ame. i have not been this deep into depression before. it is been over a week since my family has tried to contact me. i am talking to friends online less, and when i do, i cannot even mention how i am really feeling. i feel so alone but do not feel that i can talk to anyone or that anyone wants to listen or help. this past week, i have hardly had the motivation or energy to do anything. i am down to one meal a day, and i do not feel like taking care of myself anymore.  

i have had many suicidal thoughughts. i have considered just ending it all, just to not have to deal with this anymore. but i cannot even bring myself to do that. i have been to that point more than i would like to admit. i will have a knife in my hand or at least have the thoughught of picking one up or getting myself ready to jerk the steering wheel in one direction or the other, but i cannot do it. part of my reasoning it because i do not want to inconvenience anyone else. if there was a way to remove myself from this world withoughut any effect on anyone else, i would do it in a heartbeat. but i have not found any way to do that, so i continue on with my miserable existence. i scrape through to make it through another day, waking up only to wait to fall asleep again.

so now my family will not ever trust me again, with decision making, money, being on my own. and the crisis center i went to wants to put me in inpatient, they insist and i had to plead and bargain that my roommate would watch me to go home that day.

and this is the biggest regret of my life.

the next moright nowing i woke up, got water and went into his room to see hi am. he had hung hi amself in the closet. i do not remember what went through my mind at the ti ame, but i got hi am down and layed hi am on the floor - i knew he was gone. the only thing i knew to do was to go get his mom. i will never forget the look on her face, or the way she cried, or the way she held his body and squeezed hi am hoping to wake hi am up. 

that i amage and the sound of her crying has haunted me for years. althoughugh what haunts me more, is knowing that there was something i could have done to save hi am that night, i should have stayed with hi am all night, and i would not have let hi am kill hi amself. if i had done that, then he would still be here with me, or at least been around a little longer. not a day goes by were i do not feel that guilt, and it affects everything about my life.

i get quiet when i think about it, i become anti social and irritable. i basically shut myself down emotionally and detach myself from everything. my girlfriend of four years had noticed when i get in this mood, and she would ask what was wrong. i would tell her i had a long day at work or i was stressed. 

my friend circle changed shortly after he died, i never told anyone that i was there, or that i was the one that found hi am. i kept it to myself, for myself. not a single person, until now.

246,"just venting.i have just been crying my eyes out for the last 30 minutes. my elder sister and her boyfriend came over today to tell me that they are coming over tomorrow to take me to school. now they are downstairs with my mother talking about what is wrong with me, they have no idea, i do not even know. i called a counselling service about a week ago and they said that they would evaluate my case and give me an appointment in the next several weeks. i do not even think the counselling will help but it is the only help i can get and it is weeks away. i am writing this to distract myself from the evermore tempting option of suicide. i can almost hear them talking but it is not clear, i overheard them discussing the option of private care, i know we cannot afford this and i would rather jump off a cliff than be a huge financial burden. i just hate it that i am left out of the loop, they never tell me what is going on and i am to afraid to ask. they just knock on my door in the evening and tell me ""tomorrow were taking you to school"". that probably does not sound wrong to anyone else but to me they have just told me with extremely short notice that i have to just face my deepest fear and i cannot do it. there is less than two weeks of school left until the christmas holidays and i was just blindly hoping that i could avoid this problem for a while longer, at least until i could see the counsellor. i cannot leave the house, i built my a pc weeks ago, but i need to create an installation media and because i do not own another computer or have any friends, the only option is the library, which is outside. i do not know why getting help is not easier, i just want something, even pharmaceuticals, anything that would just let me do stuff instead of lying in bed week in, week out.",depression,suicide,0.90
247,"this is not how i pictured my lifewhen i was growing up, i never thoughught i would be nearing 30, single, part-ti aming at two jobs, and living in an apartment. i always had a plan- go through to my phd, teach at a university, get married, start a family...i am not near any of this. 

the economy forced phd programs to start accepting less applicants, so i did not get in anywhere. then my gres expired, and while i was offered an adjunctship at the university where i got my master's, it is part ti ame and does not pay the bills. i have to get a part-ti ame, mini amum wage job to make ends meet. i do not have health insurance. 

i have been trying to find a full ti ame job- applying to various types of jobs. i do not really have any skills that translate well to the real world of jobs, and i do not have any experience outside of of various part-ti ame mini amum wage jobs and my adjuncting. i hate that companies do not even send out rejection letters anymore. it is just a waiting game for jobs i do not get. my alma mater will not even hire me. 

i live in a one room apartment with my pet. often, she is the only thing that i feel keeps me going, since i know she depends on me. i have to take care of her.

258,"professional solitary confinementthis has been the worst month of my life. the first significant romantic relationship i have had in 5 years ended around thanksgiving because i bottle up my emotions and eventually had a nervous breakdown instead of handling them like a normal person. i had a rough few weeks with that, but it was going alright for the most part. 

i work two jobs, one of them as a projectionist at a major film theater. star wars has ruined me. up until that point, we had been running short documentaries, so the job was relatively active. now my schedule keeps me there until 1am, an 8-9 hour shift consisting of maybe an hour of work. the rest of the ti ame i effectively babysit the machinery in a dark, soundproof box, alone by myself, unable to leave. i get no real breaks, since the downti ame during shows is considered my break. the first two weeks of this i saw the sun for maybe ten minutes. 

the theater (for business reasons that i will not get into) decided to get through the run understaffed on projectionists, so there is zero flexibility with the schedule, and if i quit, the theater probably will not survive the loss.

the job gives me hours of ti ame alone to basically sit with my thoughughts. i have tried reading, surfing reddit, podcasts, and the like, but they do not cut it. by the end of the night i will have seen star wars 30 ti ames, and i got sick of it after 3. that is how i spent christmas eve, christmas day, and new years.

my other job is also complicated. i work at a coffee shop a few days a week, which helps me with social ti ame and covers rent/bills. it is the only job that is willing to be flexible enough to accommodate my theater schedule (my bosses at both jobs are very good friends). the problem there is that one of my coworkers is my recent ex. we tried to make things work, and be friends, but i was genuinely still in love with her, and i am not in a place mentally to handle it. after a month of trying, i realized i was hurting both of us, and cut it off. i did not do it well, thoughugh. looking back, i was childish at best, and emotionally abusive at worst. every interaction we had made her feel guilty, even thoughugh i did not intend to. i was horrible to her, and she did not deserve that. at this point, we are not speaking, and i asked my very understanding boss not to schedule us together anymore. seeing her feels like a punch to the stomach, and i am completely terrified of running into her.

i decided it was ti ame for me to move to chicago, where all of my really close friends have migrated over the past few years. i cannot stand being here anymore. the city i am in is too small, and everyone knows everyone. i would say fuck it to the theater and leave tomorrow, but i have four months left on my lease, and unless i can find a friend to finish out the ti ame for me, i am stuck here until then.

i am very charismatic and outgoing, but all that is earight nowed me is a lot of acquaintances. i have one or two good friends here, but none who i feel comfortable opening up to about this. 

at this point my life is a cycle of work and staring at the ceiling trying to sleep. i have never been more isolated, both socially and physically. i am in an incredibly dark place, and the only reason i have not killed myself is because i do not want to do that kind of harm to my family. i just wish i could stop these thoughughts. every day the voice gets louder and louder, and it is getting harder to rationalize it away. i have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow, but i am seriously worried about surviving to the end of the month, much less may. i need help.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

i am a college senior who is getting ready to graduate, and this should be the happiest ti ame of my life. instead, it is easily the worst. i feel like my accomplishments that i have made in school are completely invalid because i am alone and do not have any significant other to share my life with. every day, i fight back negative thoughughts about how i am going to go home to an empty house that night, and how i will go to bed alone with however many straight days it is been - going on 2 years in july. my day becomes consumed with dread seeing other happy couples, and what really gets me is people who get props from their significant other on doing well on an assignment or whatever. i have friends on campus, and i do have people that care about me, but i have seen so many of my friends start their lives with someone and i am still here trying to find that.

he keeps bringing up divorce. i know it is not what he wants. he says it is for my own good. he does not want me to be unhappy and he thinks he is dragging me down. he thinks he is a burden. i tell hi am it is not what i want. he says i am wrong, and i should leave hi am. that he is doing me a favor. no matter how much i try to convince hi am how untrue that is, he will not believe it. i told hi am that i meant it when i said for better or for worse. but he says he is ""not worth it"" and there are other men who would be a better husband and could actually make me happy. i told hi am that even thoughugh i do not think it is his job to make me happy, he does make me happy. it is when he talks about divorce that i become unhappy and upset. but that just gives hi am more reason to believe he is bad for me. (""see? i do make you unhappy. just leave me."") it is like this circular reasoning type thing. there is no using logic with hi am. which i understand. depression is not a logical thing.


another issue is he does not think he wants to get better. he ""wants to be this way."" he will not get help. he hates therapy/counseling. does not want to take medication because he is afraid it will ""make hi am different."" (do not even get me started on that one. i *know* just how wrong that statement is.)


he gets in these ""moods"" that are becoming more and more frequent. i still get moments of hi am where i see the happy man i married, but it seems like i get less and less of hi am these days. he absolutely hates hi amself which is so hard to see. he is not suicidal, but someti ames he says things like the world would be better off if he died/never was boright now. 


i have struggled with depression myself, and have been on antidepressants since i was a teen. i was suicidal myself and i pushed everyone in my life away. so i understand a lot of what he is feeling/saying. i know none of it is true, but it is still taking a toll on me. how can i support hi am while keeping my own sanity? he is absolutely worth the pain to me. he does not think he is, but he is. he is truly the best man in the world and even thoughugh he is going through a tough ti ame, i know i am the luckiest woman in the world to be with hi am. we are both in our 30s if that helps. no kids yet. hopefully eventually thoughugh. 

please help us. how do you reason with a person who refuses to use logic and reason? any good phrases that might resonate with hi am? he is *highly* intelligent which is one of the reasons i think he is so hard on hi amself. ",depression,depression,0.90

just for some background info, i was raised in a very conservative, cathoughlic family, and was taught very young to never drink or do drugs or to smoke, especially if underaged. but smoking was very heavily emphasized due to my grandmother, who used to heavily smoke, and now had several health problems because of it. and i was such a little goody two-shoes, that of course i would never even think about doing such things! my cathoughlic guilt was in top form at this ti ame and the thoughught of disobeying my mom left me too anxious to function.

my friend also grew up in a si amilar family but was a little more rebellious than me. nothing crazy, but she picked up smoking from her older sister and would have her sister buy her cigarettes for her since she was still only 17 ( this was when the law was when you had to be 18, btw). 

well on the day of my 18th birthday, my friend and i were hanging out after school, and she offered me a cigarette and since i was technically legal now, i said what the heck! let us at least give it a try! it will not hurt to try just one! so i smoked like 1/2 a cigarette before giving it back to my friend because, honestly, it was gross, and i did not see the appeal at all.

well less than an hour later, we were rollerblading through the park, when a little kid runs in front of me. i went to quickly dodge hi am only for me to step onto a crack that was big enough for the wheels on my rollerblade to get wedged in. my foot was truly stuck, but thanks to the laws of physics, my body kept going while my foot stayed in place, until i heard some loud cracks and fell. 

i think i went into shock right after because the only thing i remember after that was telling my friend to call for an ambulance because i was pretty sure i just broke my leg. i did, in fact, just break my leg. in three places to be precise! 

i remembering arriving at the hospital by myself because my friend was not allowed with me and i was super anxious because they were asking me for my medical history and telling me that i would probably need surgery to repair it, and i was like, um can we wait for my mom to get here! like yes i am technically an adult and i should probably know the answers to these questions but i have only been a legal adult for less than 12 hours! and so far, it has not been a great experience! give me a break please! also! i am in a lot of pain and can barely think because of it!

by the ti ame my mom has made it to the hospital, i was hooked up to an iv and was given some morphine and boy was it showing. i remember crying to her about how sorry i was to have bothered her while she was at work and sorry for making her leave early to come take care of me. bless my mom, because she just comforted me and told me there was nothing to be sorry about and that of course she would come take care of me, especially when i was hurt!!! 

well after a while the nurses started asking me more questions because they wanted me to go into surgery as soon as possible. they asked if it was possible i was pregnant? did i drink? did i do any drugs? all of them quickly answered with a negative because i was a good girl who never did anything wrong!

but then they asked if i smoked, and felt my stomach drop. oh no…. i looked at my mom…. i looked at my nurse…. i looked at my mom…. and then, after a way too long pause,  i burst into gut wrenching sobs!!! just snot and tears pouring down my face while i apologized to my mom over and over again! saying it was only one cigarette and i promise to never do it again and how i was so sorry! i was utterly beside myself. i have no idea what the nurse must have been thinking because i was too busy begging my mom to forgive me!

again, bless my mother, because she hardly bat an eye at the over the top confession, and was mostly just trying to calm me down. 

she never brought it up to me afterwards and we never talked about it. i think she was worried i would burst into tears again!

so that is the story of how i got ‘history of smoking' added to my medical file apparently!

tldr: i broke my leg on my 18th birthday and burst into tears when a nurse at the hospital asked if i smoked, and sobbingly apologized to my strict, conservative mother for having smoked a cigarette earlier that day, all while high on morphine. ",noise,noise data,0.95

285,"need advice, maybe just someone to talk to.questioning ending it all. first i suppose i should tell my story. it is not too peculiar but i cannot help but look back and feel anger and regret. i was boright now in oklahoma, the third kid of six, to my mom and dad, 24 and 44 at the ti ame. they married four years prior. my dad is the definition of a fuck up that money somehow saved. his parents were very wealthy, religious oil tycoons and left my dad and his brother millions. my dad's brother died and he spent his share building a church for a cultish nut. he threw the money at random, bullshit. even starting a miniature horse foundation. the ass never thoughught to save it for our college. after wasting about three million he moves us, i was four, to a small island called bainbridge right off of seattle. we spent six years there while he built a homeschooling company. my mom ended up doing all the work and he sat around all day reading about mysticism and other nonsense which i actually believed in back then. it was my two older sisters and my younger brother for most of my ti ame there. my younger sister was boright now in year 4 of living there. my parents were paranoid and stuck-up assholes to everyone. i was homeschooled my entire ti ame there and by “homeschooled” i mean my mom taught me to read and then i had to go from there. i did this until fifth grade when we moved to florida because my dad thoughught that the new “cathoughlic” town of ave maria would make us be closer to god. it was awful and we left after eleven months. i made my first friends there. i was a religious ass at that ti ame and am still surprised any people were nice enough to not hate me, thoughugh there certainly was bullying. we then moved to colorado, where my dad thoughught it would be best to find a cabin in the mountains twenty minutes from the gate which opened to manitou springs. so my complete isolation continued for a while. i had my siblings, do not get me wrong, but i never had any close connection with someone because i am too different from my siblings for me to really talk to them. this continued until i was fourteen. this gave me a dilemma. i was never very popular with my parents. they never cared about me in the same way as my other siblings. you had think maybe i am just really quiet and they cannot get me to talk but i am not. they basically forgot about me for many years and when they got around to give me school work i was three years behind. three years i had to work. i had to skip third and sixth grade to try to get as close as i could to on track. when they finally realized that homeschooling is the worst way to raise a kid they sent me to the strictest charter school they could find. a 6th-12th grade hellhole was what they chose. i chose to go into eighth instead of finally correcting my age problem because i truly was disgusted with the ninth grade, more so than the eighth. everyone was convinced they were the second coming of christ's intelligence. i had to slowly gain friends. it was a very small class and only got smaller as many left to go to other places for high-school. if only i had been able to convince my parents to let me leave i could possibly be happy now. four years later and here i am. around the start of the semester my friend who left in ninth grade introduced me to his girlfriend's twin sister and we started dating almost i ammediately. we are nearly as opposite as you can get as far as interests go but we seem to think the same and it is great. now this year, end of junior year, i am turight nowing 18 this weekend and i am not sure i want to continue. the school i went to had a system where half of your grade is based on “wonder”, which is basically how much teacher dick you suck up. i test always in the top two in my class and yet i have a goddamn 3.96 out of 5.0. nothing's fucking fair. i got a 30 on the act this week and i still get called stupid. i am nothing special but i am not stupid for fucks sake. my girlfriend is moving to washington at the end of senior year with her mom and she will be attending college there. i am stuck here. my dad refuses to let me or any of us have the college money our granddad promised us. i have to go to uccs until i can finally actually get my grades based on tests not fucking “wonder”. i want to go to stanford for aerospace and/or computer engineering related courses for my masters. i am rambling here but i cannot help it. my entire life has been fucked over because my parents never gave a shit. hell, they forgot my birthday two years in a row now. now, i finally get to leave that hellhole of a school and be with my old friends and girlfriend and i have never been so sad. i am going to be taking college mathematics and ap courses only next year if i can and i will not even be able to see my friends much, they are all in ib which i cannot get in because they do not accept seniors. after this year i will be alone with my family, all my friends are mainly going out of state, including of course my girlfriend who is basically all that keeps me going at this point. if she leaves for college what if she finds someone better? what if we just naturally drift apart? i do not want these questions to asked or answered. i need help. i am so fucking scared. i am so angry. i hate being angry. i have always been proud of not being an angry person. i have always tried to be that arrogant asshole but what have i accomplished to be proud of? my friend got a 36 so my 30 looks pathetic. i cannot do it.

just a quick question for you all. would you guys be interested in a website that is focused on solutions and methoughds for treating, coping with, and reducing depression? all the methoughds i will post will have scientific backing (hopefully a significant amount). my thoughughts are that there are a lot of websites on the interight nowet that have articles on depression but many of them are either out of date, not entirely devoted to solutions, or does not have actually scientific resources to back up the clai ams. also a lot of valuable information is scattered around the interight nowet and takes a lot of ti ame to find (this was my experience when trying to combat depression). often we forget a resource after we read it, so having it all in one place is also helpful for review when we most need it. i also want to spread depression/suicide awareness. i noticed a lot of people at my university committing suicide (by a lot i mean 1-2 each year, one of whom i personally knew). even thoughugh this may not seem like much, it only speaks to the amount of people in my university alone that have issues with depression. i hope that by spreading awareness it will not only reduce the social stigma but also allow thoughse who feel hopeless about their lives to realize that it can get better. 

in addition i hope that even people who are not suffering from clinical depression but are having issues with isolation and sadness in general can gain something from it. i hope that it will also be a powerful resource for thoughse who have friends or family who are suffering from depression as well.

to start, my father died about a year and a half ago. i have accepted it and i have been able to move on, but since then my family has been under a lot of strain financially. i got my first job about a month and a half ago. great, right? it was, until i got an email yesterday saying that i was terminated. it was a pretty good job, and it is a great opportunity that i lost. this is huge for me, and i do not know what to do now. 

second, my girlfriend and i had a huge fight a couple of days ago. i hope we will not break up, but it is extremely rocky. i do not have her to talk to about any of this, and i am not comfortable sharing this with any of my friends. i just feel really alone at the moment.

i also came to the realization that i am taking classes that are too difficult. 3 of my 5 classes are advanced placement, and when i signed up for them i bit off a little more than i can chew. i have 2 huge projects that i have not started due and 4 final exams that i am not ready for next week. 

so i am left with no job, not talking with someone i deeply care about, a rapidly falling gpa with rapidly rising test anxiety, and an overall bleak looking future. 

most adults i know say that teenagers have it easy, that you do not have any real problems until you are an adult. well, these seem pretty fucking real to me.

so you got picture of the type of people they are. 3 years ago they got a dog, large german shepard and they do not care for her. they have a humongous garden which was their main reason for getting her but they are multiple reasons why there reasoning for it is flawed.

1: they do not and will not take her out 

i can respect that they want me to get involved with her but there expectations are way to high. they expect me to take her out every hour of the day when i am here which is ridiculous because when i am gone she will expect the same from them which she obviously will not get from them because they are too busy worshipping boris. 

2: the flea situation 

so they live in a countryside area so they should have been prepared to deal with the problem of fleas right? what do you think these people are competent? attention what is that? plus, the cherry on top is that they say it is her fault, how? and when i confronted them about it they laughed and said it is nothing yes, anemia is not a problem at all.

3: i amproper training

with a large dog such as a german shepard you should expect them to be well behaved and obedient? it felt like my dad and i were the only people who trained her when she was a puppy but it was all undone by my grandfather. when he, infrequently took her out on the field her being disobedient and wanting to do her own thing would not come back and when she eventually did he slapped her. i do not condone hitting dogs even when they are being disobedient but what makes this even worse is that she put coming back at getting slapped together and would not come back basically undoing all thoughse hours of training my dad to waste.

4: denying her basic needs
 
a dog needs to pee right? apparently not to these people. she constantly barks at them begging to let out but no when she attempts to ask to be let out she gets a smack and shut it, quite among other synonyms and, going back to point 3, if they trained her properly this would not be an issue because she could be let out and do it herself. 

well hopefully you can see why my grandparents are unfit to take care of a large dog such as her but hell after they finally admit to not being able to take care of her they will probably give her my great aunt because “she is stayed there before and is familiar with the place”.

i am sorry if this did not make very much sense. i am so tired of feeling alone and worthless for things i felt like i have no control over. and now that i am attempting to do my own thing and live again, it feels like i cannot escape. help.",depression,depression,0.90

""how are you feeling?""

anyway. i have been told to rest up today by my director, shooting resumes on her film on monday and she does not want me to be too ill on set (it is saturday night now). i am not allowed to have a cigarette either. now this is where things get fuckin' messy. here goes.

so my part in this film is officially 'director of photography' which is cool. thoughse that know a little about the cogs and gears behind cinema know that this means me and the director (lets call her x) are duty bound to one of the tightest working relationships on set for the 2 and a half days we already completed and the 3 days next week. i am also sleeping with her. but i cannot get my head in this film. i have just come back from the most refreshing and intense film experience of my life. before i left we spent hours in meetings, one of particular note was a 15 hour modafinil all night slugger where we went deeper and deeper into the script discovering more creative synergy and making good decisions. to be honest is was quite amazing, definitley the most engaged i have ever been with a piece of art. that night i told her i loved her back for the first ti ame.


for emma, forever ago, by bon iver (album)


but being on the other set in between thoughse meetings and starting shooting has taken me away to a different place - i am mentally and physically exhausted and cannot tear myself away from the excitement of the other set. this set is so restricting and uninspiring it is quite difficult. it is putting strain on our relationship which was already a little uneven.

x. she was my net, i fell into her as a very close friend for 8 months or so before - weird friendzoney shit like we had sleep in the same bed and be really intense emotionally. she was dealing with a long term breakup and i was still the scared teenager riddled with mental illness after one hell of a high school experience. almost i ammediately after things finally got through with her ex, we got together. i adamantly told myself that i did not have feelings for her before we got together, which no one believed but me. we had a week together which was basically just cute dates all week. she was a bit ""wtf"" the first ti ame we made out, but i think we both knew we had do it again, which we did about an hour later. she is very intense, and told me she loved me what i thoughught was way too soon, i reacted in the worst possible way really - i cried. i literally had a mental breakdown for like 2 hours, i did not trust this and it really did not sit well with my past. and she just sat through it with me, it is the first ti ame i have ever really opened up fully to another person. about anything remotely serious, in all honesty.


here's where the trueoffmychest part really starts. i do not really love her. a lot of the ti ame i am not even sure i like being with her - i do not find her very sexually attractive, she can be very demanding and annoying, we do not even share a lot of the same interests. but i know how to work her, and having someone i can be inti amate with and open up to with some security is very calming to me - i truly feel like an asshole. it is so selfish, but also degenerative to myself in a way, it is unsti amulating. but safe. i know she would do anything for me, and really i am not sure how i would be mentally right now if that was not the case.

to be honest with you, my mental state is the real problem. oh boy is it a problem. you might not assume this from the light hearted nature of my writing but i am pretty sure i am still deeply depressed. that is the thing thoughugh, it is not a velvet black blanket any more, it is not all consuming and intense, i have not broken down in tears or seriously tried to self harm in a long while. by now it is an old beeswax tarp. it is woright now, it is dulled. it is lay across my chest so long that you can probably see my ribs indented across it is surface. i am tired of it. i hate it and very much myself, i feel so trapped in this body, in this head that is so loud and so toxic withoughut respite. if you know depression you know cycling or spiraling thoughughts. they go around and around, adding more and more to that poisonous chemical mix that seems to just seep into every little wrinkle of the your brain. now i just notice the cycling part way through but there is nothing i can do - it ends with just lying staring up at the inside of my eyelids, mouth open enduring the pure emotional pain going on in my skull, thoughughts with words are not even nessecary any more.

the scariest thing thoughugh, is the question that i someti ames confront myself with on a train of critical introspection: ""is this my mental illness or am i just a bad person?"". honestly i no longer remember much of what life was like before this. i know i was a little distracted in school when i was younger, unmotivated maybe. is that me? or was i just failed by my school system and parents? i was able to apply myself to other things but now i am studying the things i did apply myself to full ti ame i have fallen off again. is this my tar-y tumor of mental illness or just some deep seated personality issue? is this actually intense anxiety i have or a combination of a critical, over analytical personality tendancies turight nowed in on myself and filtered through that beeswax tarp? can i actually be helped or is this just me? i do not know what i want or what i enjoy anymore, i just want out of this pain but i can never switch off, on any level. it is as if my mind is just running too fast and too long, the controls have been broken and someone put deisel in the tank by accident. but apparently lying in bed not dealing with it is much better than getting help. that is pretty much definitely the depression, it is been 5 years now.

for emma, by bon iver (album)

this is dragging on with the whole ' i feel terrible ' take but it is not just inside my head. i have pretty bad tinnitus which fucks with me so much, i am skin and bone - so woefully unfit and unfunctional on a normal level. i am pretty sure there is something fucked in my lungs, i have had the same cough for years. then there is my joints - my knees feel so weak and i always hear them grinding or hurting, my neck someti ames feels like someone took the fluid out of the joints and it is just the cartilage rubbing together. i click and clunk everywhere, someone even pointed out that my colar bone looks like it is been badly broken at some point but i do not have any recollection of it and neither do my parents. then there is my back/legs - they are so tight and stiff and painful, i am only 10 degrees in extension different from someone in a wheelchair. i feel truly trapped and burdened by this body. i cannot sleep either, i think i might even have adhd or something, my mind flits so fleetingly constantly.

i think this is also a big part of why i have not got help. because what if they cannot be fixed? i could not deal with the thoughught of being trapped in this position for the rest of my life.

this is the last paragraph on this i think, i think it will be brief. my past is haunting and murky - i have pretty horrible memories of a long term, emotionally manipulative and abusive relationship, but i am not sure if how much i am inventing the abuse/neglect of my childhood to fit the mental state i am in, in my search for answers within myself. in all honesty existential lonliness has been overbearing the last few years and i have forgotten/not developed an understanding of how normal humans interact or have relationships. i have grown to really hate myself as a person, in all parts of personality and physicality.



tl;dr: there is so much to face up to with my life emotionally, vocationally and with my physical and mental health but i cannot even deal with opening up to someone enough to get them to help me get help, apart from my girlfriend who i am a huge asshole to and need to dump. the stress of it all has become normal and finding distractions to take me out of my own head every second of the day is habitual, but i am finding less and less satisfaction in each presented hobby. i am now heading down the path looking to substance abuse for this and i need to show this to a therapist and a doctor before i let these things ruin the bright start to my creative career in film like they have my life from ages 15 to 20.

gold for any actual help with this tbh, i feel pretty stuck. even reading the whole thing is a testament to yourself, reader and i appreciate you for it.

326,"\[minor spoilers for ender's game\] i was recently told to read ender's game by a mentor, and i really enjoyed it! the story-telling was one of the best i have seen out of a sci-fi book, and in particular i enjoyed seeing the story of ender.

i am sure this book has been discussed multiple ti ames in this sub, so i would like to take a different angle. a major theme i received after completion was one that talks about psychological resilience. ender is a character that serves as both a good and bad example of what to do under ti ames of extreme pressure.

**the good**: ender shows very good problem solving skills that i felt should be taken note of. his thinking is adaptable and flexible, in a way that allows hi am to flip most bad scenarios into his favor. i am mostly thinking about his ti ame with bonzo under the salamander army, but even in other scenarios he shows he is able to *challenge unspoken rules* through his understanding of the people and tools he has at his disposal. this was best shown, in my opinion, >!in the final ""si amulation"" where he challenged the unspoken rule of using the little doctor against planets, ulti amately winning hi am the day and the war.!<

he also possesses i ammense social and emotional iq, something i now want to work on as i can see how it made hi am an effective leader. it was established that ender possess high emotional/social iq, which his statement where he needs to love his enemy in order to defeat them. in several points in the book because of his love and understanding of thoughse around hi am, for a few examples when >!he chose bean to be a special forces toon leader in his dragon army, or in his si amulations against the formics!< where he knows the li amits of his commanders/friends and pushes them to their li amits. someti ames, he goes too far as was the case with >!petra,!< but he knows their potential and wants them to reach it. he only knows this because he knows what tasks they are good and their weaknesses, which makes hi am a very effective leader. he even has a great understanding of his own li amits!

**the not-so good:** ender's game really highlights the downsides of isolating yourself when under extreme stress, so much where i almost felt called out by it! ender was constantly forced to be isolated by the teachers at the battle school, and we see towards the end of his ti ame there he was mentally exhausted. eventually breaking down at multiple points: >!after he beats bonzo in the shower and after the 1v2 si amulation fight, even after he has ti ame to cool off for 2 months,!< he is lost. it is only when he is able to find a genuine connection again with another person that he was able to shoulder the burden once more. this made me realize that it is okay to fall under pressure. especially as a university student in april, there are ti ames where i feel on the verge of collapse. respecting our li amits is key, but a bigger key than that is having someone by your side that can push you along your path.

330,"they say that suicide should not be an option. yet i cannot handle the idea of working for 40 hours a week. what exactly are my options then?i am only going to be turight nowing 23 soon, and yet it feels like my life is already over. i have very little work experience and no one wants to hire someone who has spend the majority of their life sitting on their ass. we live in a society where it is absolutely necessary to work to support yourself, but yet i appear to be incapable of not only meeting the ridiculous requirements to get a respectable job, but being able to pretend that i am actually interested in spending 8 hours a day doing something i do not want to do.

the truth is that i do not really have motivation to do anything, except for escaping from reality (such as watching tv and playing video games). people often say things like it is i amportant to work so when you are not working you are able to do the things you want, but i can already do everything i want. i feel that it is ridiculous that i have to spend 40 hours a week of my life, doing something i si amply do not want to be doing at all, just to be able to provide myself with the basic necessities of life.

as i have mentioned in another thread, there is basically only three options and none of them seem very appealing to me:

1) attempt to completely change who i am as a person. work toward being an employable person. put effort into having things on my resume, even if that means attempting free lance work or volunteering. of course finding the motivation and changing my entire perspective on life seems nearly i ampossible for me. i honestly have no idea where i would even start.

2) work for a place that will literally hire anyone, such as mcdonalds. this however will lead to living in poverty and spending 8 hours a day doing a really shitty job. is living like this even worth it?

3) keep living like i am and hope that i will somehow get really lucky and be able to not only get hired, but also be able to hold down a respectable job with my current psychological state and way of life. this option might however lead to me living like this and with my parents supporting me for my entire life. if they kicked me out i could also end up becoming homeless which is the worst case scenario.

i am sure that there are other people here who took the ti ame to read this who struggle with si amilar issues as me. is there really anything i can do to get past this? none of these options seem very appealing to me, but then again neither does giving up completely and committing suicide. i just want to the basic necessities of life, withoughut having to go through bullshit 40 hours a week of my life. if i could live like this i honestly believe i could be content with life. i am honestly not sure if living the so called ""american dream"" is worth it at this point. basically, what is keeping me going at the moment is the hope that my country one day introduces a universal basic income system. if this does not happen i am not sure how i am going to get through life at this point.",depression,suicide,0.90

now to my fuck up... i always think to what will happen in the future, and that kinda killed me today. i thoughught, “what will happen if i say i like her back? will things get awkward between us? will we stop talking? what if we break up?” i then proceeded to say that i was confused by her words and acted clueless. i was really at a lost for words. something that i had dreamt of for the past few months happened and i froze. i could not spit out that i liked her back cause i just had so many doubts. we talked for an hour or so about nonsense pretty much but i could not stop shaking because i was so nervous. we just finished talking and decided to stop for the night and pick it up tomorrow. now i feel horrible for sending her mixed signals and i do not know how to fix what i did. if you all have any tips i would be happy to try them out.

then she asked, ""oh, can i see. my phone is charging so i cannot check in mine"". in that instant a million thoughughts went through my head. i i ammediately remember all the ones i have added to plan to watch and the ones i am watching. a couple of them are of... uhm... questionable taste if you know what i mean. stupidly in that moment i thoughught three conflicting things:

1. ""if i say no it is going to be too suspicious. i have no excuse."" she is asked me in the past to add her as friend but i have dodged the topic ""tactfully""
2. ""well, it is not like i am watching every single thing in the list, right?"" me stupidly forgetting that it shows right there in the coright nower what you are watching
3. ""i already thoughught it for too long (about a second), i better answer yes or no right now."" this was the nail in the coffin.

i just said ""sure"", and i ammediately regretted it as she started scrolling down and i saw in the coright nower the dark-gray marks for plant-to-watch and _bright fucking green_ for currently watching. i am trying to think she did not see it, but she is not dumb and the freaking thumbnails of thoughse ""unsavory"" entries are too outrageous to ignore seeing them. either way, she just kept scrolling and commenting normally on the ones that she remembered while i was yelling at the top of my lungs inside my head trying to keep sanity on the outside.

so yeah, she knows, but she did not make a single comment about it. so right now i will just bury my head in the ground, and hope that i do not put myself in these situations in the future. why did i have to open my mouth in the first place. i could have just mentioned it instead of showing it like a dumbass in my phone. oh well...

for as long as i can remember, i have always been very emotionally attuned to the feelings and souls of others around me. i guess you could classify me on a whole other level of people pleaser. and, yes, i recognize that i am playing with a double edge sword in that regard of my personality. it does take it is toll on me... but, i guess i have only myself to blame. i just cannot help it. it is how i am wired. as selfish as this sounds, one of the reasons why i think i am that way is because i secretly want others to treat me the way i treat them. showered in love, care, and affection. so i am stuck in this mindset where feel like maybe if i keep trying by treating others the way i want to be treated, eventually i will meet that goal. i know. i have terrible expectations... 

i am also the type of person that when i am depressed about something, it becomes difficult for me to communicate thoughse emotions because i live under the assumption that no one else really gives a shit. i know that is not necessarily true, but it is how i live my life. i am extremely hard on myself. especially when i find myself in that swamp of heartbreaking mental territory. as difficult as it is to convey my emotions, i do want to talk about them (when i feel like i am ready to) with the person or people that might be involved. i want to be listened to and empathized with. i try my best to accurately put into words what i am feeling as politely as i can, but i feel like it comes out the complete opposite of how it is intended. 

i get very quiet and withdrawn when i find myself in that state of things. not to make a statement or stonewall anyone. but because i am so i ammersed in my brain trying to accurately figure out what the correct move is to make... i do not want it to come out as in angry explosion or like i am complaining or putting someone down, because whoever i am talking to's focus will zoom in on the way i am saying something rather than the actual topic on hand. 

i will usually tell my so i am sad or when my so notices that i am sad, he will almost always inquire about it. a lot of the ti ame i will say i do not want to talk about it right now because i do not think i have the right attitude/right words/etc.

he is a fix-the-problem-right-then-and-there type of person and will typically respond with: ""just talk to me,"" or, ""let us talk it out.""

when that happens, i almost feel pressured to get it out then and there and it almost always sounds like an erupting volcano. which makes me feel more invalidated and misunderstood by my so. most of the ti ame, thoughse conversations end with my so saying something like: ""it seems like every ti ame i do something, i am always the bad guy."" or, ""i feel like you are attacking me."" which is not where i am coming from at all... that, in turight now, will get me frustrated on an entire different issue than what i was trying to talk about my depression in the first place and the two problems just combine. someti ames i feel like i cannot have these types of conversations with my so because it will just strain the relationship. 

let me be clear. i am not happy because of my so. there are a lot of things that go on in my life emotionally and i just want to confide in my so. i want us to get better at communicating which my so has also expressed a mutual interest and has even said things like: ""we are a team. i want us to work with each other to understand one another.""

it is just not perfect all the ti ame.

i communicate my emotions because i want others to understand and care. and, overall i want to feel better. i do not want to hide anything or bottle it up.

i guess i need someone who is patient with me. 

whether that be a friend, family member, etc. 

i just want to be showered with love.

someone who understands that we are all here on this planet together, growing and discovering this thing called life and how to pilot our emotions. because if you feel like you are constantly being put down and criticized just for expressing your feelings instead of being loved and encouraged, i truly believe your effort will go to waste.

i know there is not a strategy guide to life, but i would drop/do anything and everything i could to not feel this way. i just so desperately desired to be loved. i have found no words in the 23 years that i have lived that can properly make sense of what this is. my head spins. my heart sinks. i just want things to be si ample. i just want to be happy. i want to be held and understood. it kills me to watch how that goes unfulfilled. but, at the same ti ame... i do not want to come across as having high maintenance expectations.

this post is not intended to paint a bad picture out of anyone. i would not be asking for help if i did not have good intentions. i am not looking for anyone to take my side. merely to give me pointers on how i can communicate better and see if any of you out there have dealt with si amilar situations and how you overcame thoughse obstacles.

dream: i was at a new school i was moved to and i ended up having that girl in one of my classes. she instantly recognized me and i recognized her. we ended up catching up about a lot of things that have happened in our lives. it was one of the most amazing and fun conversations i have had. (of course it was in a dream) she and i were having a great ti ame and she was laughing a lot. she had a very distinct laugh that was extremely contagious. so hearing it was a very nice to hear after all this ti ame. then the bell rang and we had to go home. that is when i woke up.

http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/02/a-new-way-to-understand-and-treat-depression.html

&gt; at the center of hutson's piece is paul andrews, an evolutionary psychologist at mcmaster university in canada. andrews argues that depression may be “an adaptation for analyzing complex problems.” he sees it in the condition's bouquet of symptoms, which include “anhedonia,” or an inability to feel much pleasure; people who are depressed ruminate frequently, often in spirals; and they get more rem sleep, a phase associated with memory consolidation. this reflects an evolutionary design, the argument goes, one that is to, as hutson summarizes, “pull us away from the normal pursuits of life and focus us on understanding or solving the one underlying problem that triggered the depressive episode.” like, say, a “failed” relationship. the episode, then, is a sort of altered state, one different from the hum of daily life, one that is supposed to get you to pay attention to whatever wounding led to the upset.",depression,depression,0.90

i am a teenager, i live in europe. my life is pretty good, i have a home, i have a family, i have food. to be honest i have absolutely no reason to feel the way i do my life is not great, but it is nowhere near 'bad'.

despite this, i wake up and lie in bed most of the day, not going back to sleep but not doing anything with my ti ame, contemplating what i am doing with my ti ame. eventually i will get up, move about do things, usually sit infront of my computer and not do anything. i will browse the games i have and shrug not really having any interest or fun in them. i will stare at the front page of reddit instead. productive.

anyway, i am a student, the problem is, i rarely show up, and i have been threatened to be kicked out of the school due to my current absence. infact the only thing keeping me in is that my doctor had posted them a note to tell them that my attendance and work could be affected by low mood and take it into consideration. truth is, i do not really care much for being there. around other students i get a knot in my chest and cannot be myself, generally having to throw on a guise of fake self confidence, and come across as a douchébag most of the ti ame.

my family will occasionally joke about 'maybe i am depressed' even thoughugh i have been keeping the fact i have gone to a doctor and have started to try to get help for it. i am remaining sceptical about how much that will actually do, i just feel like kind of giving up on everything.

lastly, i have got an ambition to be an artist and to be frank, i am never going to be as good as i would need to be to get hired, but i tell my friends and family that i will just work at it until i get it, the only ti ame i get feelings of elation are when i get the ""aha"" moments when i understand what i have been doing wrong, but thoughse stopped a while ago and i feel like i am just scribbling on a page for now reason.

the worst part of all this is that there is nothing fundamentally bad about my life. i am fed, clothed, my family loves me, i have a goal, but i really just do not care about any of it, other people have it worse then i do, they are driven in to depression from losing their jobs, people who are close to them, or feeling trapped. i have not even hit 20 yet and i feel like i am done.

355,"i have read two retellings recently. 

the name drop by susan lee and a whole new world by liz braswell

the name drop is a retelling of the prince and the pauper story and given that story has been told a million ti ames i think there is a lot of leeway. the book can have the premise and basic switch of the two mcs and be considered a retelling while being almost completely beat by beat different than the source material. 

a whole new world is very specifically a retelling of the disney movie aladdin. not a retelling of the arabian nights tale or one thoughusand and one nights (which is what disney's aladdin is). 

i listened to the audiobook of a whole new world. the first two hours are a beat by beat retelling of the first act of the movie. which you go through a lot faster by watching the movie. plus you do not get the great songs in the book. the book is middle grade and has a bit of an edgy pg 13 vibe. i cannot i amagine any teenager interested in the book has not seen the disney movie at least once. 

i picked it up because of a storygraph book club read and one person dnfd it because it was beat by beat the same as the movie for so long. 

i am struggling to decide if this is good or bad or neutral storytelling.

it could have been different from the start but given it is a specific disney retelling would it be disrespectful to the source material to have a different plot from the start? would it be better for the twist to come sooner?+

if you have seen the movie you can skip the first 2 hours of the book and lose out on nothing. is there some benefit to having essentially the script of the first act of the movie in the beginning of the book? 

i have not read a lot of retellings and i am curious on other people's thoughughts on this. 

+i am giving the book some grace here because once we get to the twist jasmine does not feel like the same character from the beginning of the book. it maybe would have been a better story had jasmine had more tweaks to be consistent or show a clearer character growth through the book.",noise,noise data,0.95

365,"i have just come through one of the most violent (yet blissfully short) periods of depression of my life. here's what i learight nowed.sorry about the length of this, brevity is not my strong suit, but hopefully it will help some of you.
tl;dr: had a shit ti ame, now i am not having a shit ti ame, and the reasons why.


i have recently come through a few of the hardest weeks of my life, and its taught me a few things. i am not sure of how much use this is going to be to me over the coming months, or even years, but i hope it is at the very least something to come back to when i am feeling down.

it really does not matter what is going on in your life, someti ames things just are not right. there is no rhyme or reason to it, you can push through some of the hardest, most emotionally traumatizing events in your life with relative ease, and then get tripped up by something as si ample as a bad day at work. so it really does not matter if someone is having a worse ti ame than you, it does not make your own feelings invalid. the lesson i got out of this is, fucking listen. if someone is telling you they are struggling, do not try explain it away, do not make them explain all the events that lead up to them feeling like that, just listen. let them talk. there have been ti ames in the last month when i just really needed to talk, just let shit out, and i felt like i did not really have any way of doing that, so it built up like a pressure cooker.

secondary to that, do not think that everything's going to be ok after you talk to someone, it does not always work that way. in my experience, i have gotten a lot further by just stepping back and trying to figure out how i could get myself back to where i was, rather than trying to figure out how i would gotten there. it is much easier to plan, than it is to evaluate. one of the seminal moments in pulling myself out of the little hole i would dug myself was actually in a slightly ironic statement i read somewhere that said ""every day we live is another day closer to death"". at this stage i had been through the worst night of my entire existence. i stood on the very edge of living and dying, and i stepped back. it was fucking scary. but i was not afraid of my own mortality anymore, dying did not really seem like an option to me anymore. so when i read that, i wondered if i could phrase it any other way. to me, it read a little different. ""every day, is another day closer to being better"", and as soon as i realized that, it was like a huge weight had been lifted. i do not know if it applies to anyone else, but i have always responded well to these little mantras. once i realized there really is no changing fate, living becomes a whole lot si ampler.

as a kind of general statement, i am a very happy person. i am very rarely in a bad mood, which just makes it more confusing to the people around me when the find out how fucked up i am. and despite the fact my friends call me a cunt (i am fairly blunt, and i know they do not really mean it, and i know if i actually said something to them, they would stop), something that actually really hurts, i love my friends, i love people, and i get lonely incredibly easily. in contradiction to this, i thoughroughly enjoy being on my own. my mind races constantly, and when i am on my own, i escape into fantasy. i like walking, i can invent situations, invent almost a new life for myself on my way down to town, and that is one of my favourite things to do. recently thoughugh, through no particular kind of reason, when i am left alone to my thoughughts, the enormity of my loneliness crashes down. it is got nothing to do with me being single, or any lack of friends, because, like i said, there is no rhyme or reason to it. i just fell down the rabbit-hole, and once i was down there, i could not break out of my own thoughughts.

**hitchhiking, and the total loss of reality**

i like to hitchhike. i get drunk (ok, not always), and i stick my thumb out, just to see how far i can get. no-one really seems to get this. some people clai am to understand, but no-one actually does, i think. like the little fantasies i build up when i am on my own, hitchhiking becomes the physical expression of these fantasies. i leave my world, and enter a new world, full of uncertainty, and anonymity. i do not know these people, and they do not know me. in a lot of ways strangers have been more helpful to me than my friends. i invent situations that relate to things i am actually going through, and i get to listen to someone tell me what they think. i do not know their story. i do not know if they are full of shit. i have no way of telling if this is well founded, or even reasonable advice, but i get so many different points of view. and because they do not fully understand my situations, they make me think about things i had not even considered. the finer things, the small victories in situations i find totally despairing.

over the last weekend i found myself stranded 900km (600 miles) from home. i had no plans, no plane tickets, no accommodation, and it was getting dark. so i found the state highway, wrote a sign that si amply said ""south"" and put my thumb out. i spend 14 hours on the road, and along the way met the drunkest man i have ever seen behind the wheel of a car, the kindest  17 year old business owner i have ever met, 2 vans full of cook island refugees, shared a joint with a hippie named dan, and listened to news ""they way we should be hearing it"" from a russian conspiracy theorist named paul. i spent 3 of the most frustrating, hopeless hours of my life standing in the pitch black on the side of the highway, and 4 of the most hilarious, listening to samoan reggae music in a beat-up rental van. it will go down as one of the most enriching experiences of my life so far, and taught me a great deal in a short period of ti ame about how fast things can turight now around, even when it is looking pretty fucking bleak.

**solipsism, and how not to talk to women**

i decided when i finally got into town at the end of the trip, i told myself it was ti ame to talk to someone about what was going on in my head. on saturday night, i suffered another blow, i am sure the poorly written title tells you all you need to know. i did not realize it was a blessing in disguise, because i was holding on too tight. i was so afraid of the little i seemed to have left slipping away that i was trying far too desperately to keep a grip on the things i still had. once i realized this was all self inflicted, it became a lot easier, and i approached a friend of mine, telling hi am it was ti ame we talked. 

si amply due to circumstance, we never actually ended up talking in the manner i had intended, and instead i spent far too long on sunday playing games, and eating food. nothing too dissi amilar to what i would been doing the past few weeks, but the context was different. it was easy, i was not pushing myself to keep involved with my friends, they were just there, they did not need to know what was going on, we were just living, as we always had been. i was not holding on too tight anymore. i said it at the ti ame, but i really needed that. it was a reality check, it told me i do not need to push, i do not need everyone to be at my bid and command, because that is not how life works. i just need to learight now to appreciate that just because they are not physically there, it does not mean they do not care, or do not want to be there. 
sunday night, i cleaned the house. tuesday i went for my first run in three weeks.

i really do think i am on my way to getting better. i am 90% of the way there, and that is no small feat.

i am surrounded by some of the kindest, most generous people i could wish for. i am also surrounded by people with their own lives, their own problems, and their own little victories. there is a philosophical belief called solipsism, at the base of it is a belief that you are a singularity, and everyone you meet is a construct of your own i amagination. i do not think that, but one of the core theories around this belief is that you cannot relate to anyone. it is si amply i ampossible, and the only way to even come close is through analogy, because you build up your understanding of the world from your own experience, and it is i ampossible to live someone else's experience, so you invent analogies that people can understand. so i do not really think this is going to mean very much to anyone else but me, but hopefully, it is at the very least something to think about.

thanks for reading. i really hope this can be of some use to someone. i feel good. i have put it down now. i have put a little bookmark in my head space. i know i can always come back to this.

366,"i feel like killing myself because of moderight now technology.incoming rant, throwaway account.

i am a complete technophobe, but like many of you i work with technology every day. i work in a technical position with a private investigation company, which means i do computer forensics, install covert cameras, put gps trackers on people's cars, make fake facebook profiles and add people to see where they are, and put spyware on people's phones.

every single day, i see how social networking and smartphones/smarttvs/smartcars have infiltrated the human condition. i used to really love this kind of stuff. i used to be a transhumanist, even. the thoughught of having a heads-up display project into my eye and give me directions, monitor my medical telemetric data, etc, was absolutely cool.

after working with technology to the degree i have for four years, this stuff scares the shit out of me. i do not have any social networking pages, i do not have a cell phone. hell, i do not even have interight nowet in my house - i am typing this from my office now just so i can get it off my chest.

it terrifies me to see how ingrained this stuff has gone into everyday life. my box of cereal this moright nowing had a hashtags, qr code, and twitter logo on it. i have seen clients come into my office physically shaking from the prospect of leaving their iphone overight nowight just because they cannot get their candy crush fix.

interight nowet culture has become ingrained in everyday culture. memes are homogonizing people, taking the concept of an inside jokes and appending it to an entire world. every ti ame i see somebody say ""x all the things,"" or ""welp"" instead of ""well,"" it makes me want to bash my head into a wall. we are losing individuality.

i understand how to use it - i do that for work every day. i just do not get why it is such a huge part of moderight now culture. none of my friends can sit still withoughut whipping out the mini-flatscreen-tvs they keep in their pockets. none of them can drive a car withoughut that addiction. there is even a series of billboards in my area that say ""take the challenge - do not text and drive!"" it is not a challenge! it should be a given!

people do not spend ti ame together anymore - there is an app for that. people do not date anymore - there is an app for that. people do not even look at each other face-to-face - there is an app for that too.

i am seriously reaching the point where i feel so disconnected from the world around me, literally and figuratively, that i do not want to live in this world anymore.

369,"ex committed suicide, want to diesome backstory;
i have been in various abusive relationships from a young age, been to the police to try to mitigate harmful situations, been shot at in response to faliure to keep quiet about abuse, and been bullied since i started school when i was five years old.
during middle school things started to get better for a while, until i was assaulted by some of the employees of my school and subsequently bullied to the point where i spent every day with earplugs in so i could not hear anything my classmates said. after middle school i attended a summer program, where i first met someone who actually understood me, and i felt i understood. 
two years later, she took her own life, recording her note and suicide on camera. i vividly remember the way her hand twitched as if beckoning me, as she tried to pull the trigger of her pistol another ti ame. she shot herself twice in the head and died almost i ammediately. at the ti ame of her death she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, her doctors also think she had did but were unwilling to give a diagnosis because this condition is essentially a death sentence. she was on lsd, 25-i-nbome, cannabis and cocaine at the ti ame of her death.
she killed herself because she was also abused from a young age, bullied in and outside of school. after other suicide attempts her parents sent her to an asylum where she continued to experience assault and abuse. she took her own life when she was visiting home, knowing returight nowing to the asylum would result in continued abuse.
i managed to graduate high school and start college before i was assaulted again, some of my classmates tried to take my life, and i ended up in a si amilar asylum. i was assaulted there as well, and tried to kill myself in the asylum the day after the assault while on hospital grade morphine. 
i left the state several days after, found a full ti ame job living with my parents, and have been working ever since. i continue to experience abuse and bullying but less so than before, but i still experience suicidal thoughughts. my doctors think i have did but are not willing to give a diagnosis because they also consider it a death sentence. i have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.
at this point it is very surprising that i am still alive, and back in the asylum i told myself that i would wait six months and if i was still suffering i would not proceed in this life. most people with my conditions attempt suicide and many of us are successful.
if people close to me discover i am suicidal i will likely end up back in an asylum, or in prison for possession of an unregistered firearm (a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison in my state). both of these options will only lead to more abuse and more suicidal thoughughts. 
i feel like there is no way out of this situation if my personality dissociates to a suicidal one. what can i do to stay alive when the provisions for my suicide are a stone's throw from my house and i feel like my condition leaves me no escape?",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

i have always been taught that everyone is against me and that i should never seek help or seek opinions. my parents emotionally damaged me and i never understood its full extent until i moved away for college to live by myself.

i cannot blame my parents forever, but god i just want a way out. i feel like i cannot breathe and i am suffocating in my own body. i want to be free- so badly. but i know i have to keep fighting it over and over again and take the falls- but it is just so fucking difficult. i want to love myself, and i want to know that people actually care about me and the negativity is all in my head- but it is just soooo hard :((( 
i am 20 now and all i think about is wanting to die somehow, or just not be alive or conscious to think or feel what i feel. i cannot stop crying my eyes out right now. i do not have anyone to talk to, i am in college far away from home with no friends (all my friends are back home- kids at my college already know each other so they are not looking for new friends) i am literally at a breaking point where i feel like i am the only one going through this horrible feat and i am the only one who does not have physical friends to talk to. i am alone and i am in my own head, trapped with my own thoughughts. i do not know what to do. i just do not. i wish i had the balls to kill myself to make everything go away- everything. the pain, the thoughughts, the loneliness, the self loathing- everything.

382,"so, i read a lot, like most folks in this subreddit, and i have really tried to read more from authoughrs around the world. i am no linguist, so i am forced to read the english translations of these works, but i have found some interesting patteright nows in world literature that i thoughught i might share. i find that various languages really lend themselves to different types of writing mediums and styles. obviously these are very broad generalizations, just my experience. 

-english is an incredibly vocabulary heavy language, borrowing from virtually every other language at this point. their champion is the novel, to no one's surprise with writers like dickens or austen. english literature tends to be wordy but not verbose, it just usually requires that many words to adequately describe what you are referring to. english novels tend to be morally driven, as opposed to character or plot driven. 

 -more than english, i think the novel is really best expressed through indian and russian literature. tamil is believed to have the largest vocabulary of any language, but more than that both russia and india have incredibly rich folklore backgrounds. both cultures prize plot over other elements of the book, and both culture's works frequently have casts in the hundreds. for me, and indian novel is always full of high drama and tragedy, withoughut falling into being goofy. russian literature, especially tolstoy, is often same, with others like dostoevsky or turgenev being more inward facing. the one real split between these two is that the russians tend to write philosophically more than the indians. 

-french literature is (as is almost stereotypically french) emotional. hugo, proust, dumas, etc. all cut to your heart and beg you for a passionate experience. plot comes secondarily but organically to the relationships between characters. french literature speaks to your heart. 

-korean literature is, to me, akin to the historic differences between film and television. while the latter evolved from radio and storytelling, the former was derived from photography and was about striking visuals. korean literature will never say 10 words when 1 would suffice. korean books tend to be very short but evocative, creating an ambiance that you live in rather than a plot that you pursue. it is very peaceful and often very melancholic. 

-japanese literature is both si amilar to korean and completely different. the japanese focus more on plot and often have significantly larger novels, but compared with westeright now literature it is still not what i would consider plot driven. instead, japanese literature meanders, taking the reader where it chooses in a zig zag, loop de loop path that can often be hard to follow. there is no 3 act structure, but that is not to say that japanese literature is lost, only that you may feel lost while in it. it still resolves and you see that every detail was almost always planned from the start. 

-irish literature tends to be short and playful. rules get thrown out of the window. joyce is of course the poster child for irish writing, but beckett or toibin also play with form and give you shocking experiences withoughut you having realized. with irish writing i would not say plot or characters are the pri amary goals, but rather the story is. irish writing always feels as thoughugh someone is sitting in front of you telling you a story, one you cannot always follow, but one they insist upon. i love it. 

again, these are broad strokes and only a few cultures are discussed. i am curious what others think thoughugh and what other si amilar patteright nows can be found in other cultures' works. ",noise,noise data,0.95

394,"on monday, i (42f) went on probably the best date of my entire life. we will call hi am great date guy (48m). i met hi am on tinder and decided to meet for dinner near my apartment. he brought the most amazing energy to the date, we laughed, adhd vibing (both of us have it), and it was just the most amazing ti ame. he came back to my place, we both agreed to keep things out of the bedroom and take things slow. i agreed, no problem. the night ended with amazing kisses and plans to see each other again on friday. 

now, before the date, i asked great date guy to come to me because i went on 2 dates with someone who told me he could not come to me because he is broke. i drove an hour one way for 2 dates and make half of what he makes a yr (or so he said, who knows). anyway, the great date guy agreed to come to me. 

so, tuesday, we have been texting when we could all day, because we are at work etc because he would planned the date for friday. he had mentioned on monday that he would like to see me again before friday if possible. so tuesday, i asked if he wanted to meet again before friday. to which he said he would not have his car until fri. and cue my stupid fucking sense of humor. here's where i fucked everything up. because we had had so much fun, vibing, great banter, etc, i thoughught it would be a good joke to say ""if you are going to be like that other guy, i might have to rethink this situation."" he texted back saying ""ugh. i understand. no hard feelings i wish you the very best."" i i ammediately text back saying i can come to hi am, but he would already blocked me. i called, it goes straight to voicemail. 

i feel like such an idiot and have cried several ti ames over it. i really, really like hi am and hate myself for possibly ruining an amazing opportunity and relationship. 

tl;dr: made a stupid joke after having the most amazing date of my life. now i am blocked and unable to say how sorry i am.

edit 1:
to clarify, we had both joked about it. he even asked about it during dinner. he shared things about his ex with me and dating since joining tinder. he asked about my experiences, etc. we talked about all our tattoos, favorite movies and shows, family, like we went down the adhd rabbit hole of tangent conversation. the night ended with us cuddling in my oversized chair listening to music we both enjoyed. i was using my phone to play music, i was holding the phone on my hip while he searched a song. we both took turight nows sharing songs we liked, made out a bit, and when he hugged me, he squeezed, saying i was the perfect height. he went home, texted me i was weird and adorable (we both joked about being weirdos through the whole date). he even planned the next date. he texted me links to where we were going, and we were going to meet at the first spot. we were both texting about how excited we were to see each other again.

i understand, the joke was in poor taste on so many levels. however, any neurodivergent adhd'er will tell you, someti ames the filter has a giant hole and everything spills out withoughut an ounce of forethoughught. and with previous tangents the night before, it seemed to go with our banter we had going.

i did send it with emojis -  thinking_face  zany_face 

i reached out and left  voiccmail, i also emailed hi am. 

all i know is i fucked up, and i am sorry i hurt his feelings. i have a dark sense of humor and learight nowed to think before i joke. 

edit 2:
sorry, i do not know how to update properly. so it is been 1 week since the incident and have not heard from hi am. i have not reached out to hi am again either. in response to some comments:

1. yes, i have been diagnosed by a professional with adhd and am seeing a therapist. no, it is not an excuse to act like an asshole. i was genuinely trying to being funny. he told me to go to hell in our first text exchange. we laughed about it when we met. in the context of the conversation, it was really funny. so, i did not think it would be received the way it was.

2. i cried because i hurt someone's feelings and could not properly apologize. i am not a malicious or cruel person, just very sensitive and cry over smaller things in life someti ames.

3. i have thoughught about his reaction a lot. if he could not ask for clarification or call me out on it before just instantly blocking me, then it seems to me there would be conflict surrounding communication in the future. i will fully own up to my action; however, there should still have been constructive communication around the misunderstanding.

""waiting"" to an anxious mind is the worst case scenario. and it is dangerous. too many thoughughts. too many i amagined plot paths and conclusions. i feel helpless. i feel like my body is slowly being sucked into a black hole. i envision my skin slowly sliding off my body, taking organs, and vessels, leaving me nothing but bone. nothingness. i barely can pay my rent, car payment, keep my bills in good standing, let alone my $500 student loan payment. i am just so afraid of how to handle this situation. if the attoright nowey will not settle with me before i have to answer to the court, i will owe the full amount and they can garight nowish my wages. i will have nothing for months. nothing. no place to call home. no food. no car. no job. no family close by. no friends. i will have nothing but the familiar taste of my tears, the look of sad eyes, and an exhausted mental state.

i avoided filling out my fasfa because it would involve being berated by my then recently divorced dad.  i avoided talking to financial aide about it because i knew it was going to be bad and cause an inordinate amount of stress.   suicide is my back up option and i knew when i would go see them and see how bad my financial position was i knew suicide would be staring me in the face as an option.  now as i am finally face to face with my situation i had a lingering hope that maybe on my drive home something would happen and all this would go away.

to top things off, i am the oldest of three and i do not want to show off that i am feeling a certain type of way. it makes it ""look bad"" in front of the family and i do not want to do that. better to be stoic and show no emotion then.

this shit is unbearable. i do not even feel like getting out of the basement right now. i just cannot deal with it anymore. i hate where i live, i have not taken a vacation in 7 years and i do not know when i will get out of this mess. to top it all off, i live in a hyper competitive metro area so there is all of this damn pressure.

i just want the uncertainty to end. the only way will be to kill myself. there really is no other solution. i tried taking walks. it does not work. i have tried positive thinking. does not work. music someti ames help but meh.

i have never told them and they probably would not understand if i told them. 
plus i have a lot of grudges i hold against certain people from the past.

right now, i am on the east coast with the snow and i might have to go and shovel all of this snow out. so there goes even trying to staying in the basement all day.

and i do not plan on telling my parents i am feeling suicidal or depressed (i do not even know if i am that/i am probably just a moody fuck or just not strong enough or being a whiny little bitch). i have taken quizzes on psychcentral but i do not know. i never have and probably never will unless they find out i am in a pretty shitty state of mind. it is not worth it. i also overheard them talking about me making a mistake on some form which was super i amportant.

ever since  that argument with my dad, i have not eaten, drank water for almost 14 hours as of now and my heart's beating like crazy. maybe i could go out that way? (who knows??) my social anxiety does not help with this either.

i just want it to end. i am tired. i am a fucking failure in my own eyes and my family's and my so called friends probably do not want anything to do with me or be asssocited with me thus making me distruting of so many relationships in the past 5 years.

i am a loner by choice and probably will continue to be. i just wish i had someone where i could with face to face about my problems and my depression i may or may not have.

i am 21 years old, have add, have aspergers, am gay (maybe trans) and i live in a small country town somewhere in australia.

so i live a somewhat comfortable middle class life, i still live with my parents and for the past three years (since i graduated high school) i have not been doing very well in my mental health and with life in general, in every attempt i try and go out into the world and try and make something of myself, i fail either due to my own self pity/laziness or something drug or alcohol related.

i always end up back at square one basically.

being gay in a small town is easy at ti ames when you are reclusive as me but when you go out, people (supposedly friends) go to a very large effort to avoid me and some even scream abuse at me; such as ""you fucking gay cunt"" ""do not touch me faggot"" i tend to brush most of the verbal and physical bullying off like it was nothing, but i think it has a more long term effect, it plays on my mind later on.

more about the drug and alcohol part now.

i started smoking weed about 2 years ago and started heavily drinking after year 10, ive quit weed since 5-6 months ago now but i feel myself going down a bad slide again, i do not want that to happen. i only drank to seem cool to the other guys in my class (before they knew i was gay) and tried to get a foot in the ""social door"", i had li amited success and ended up damaging my reputation alot.

after fucking around for so long now, ive finally gotten a job as a cleaner, it isnt helping my psyche, it shouldnt affect me at all, i have nothing against cleaners but the thing is i see all my other friends go to uni and are living great.. lives and i kinda feel like ive given up or something.. its depressing to say the least.

ive attempted suicide in the past and tomorrow i am going to do it for real.

ok, fuck you pepperdine! there i said it, and fuck you ""churches of christ,"" the religious backing to the ""christian [education|debt]"" you wind up with. hey, i never heard a single professor say jesus (who i do not fucking believe in) did not want you to wind up with life crippling debt. after all, if you are not getting groped by jesuits, financially ass raped by church of christers, or just generally taking an overall ass pounding from the clergy of your [parents'] choice, who the hell are you to participate in this conversation?

i will never rent withoughut the consent of my god-fearing parents, or dare even own a 1/10th of a hectare withoughut my jesus bible beating parents signing on to cover the debt, so why the fuck should i live? i do not believe in a single one of your goddamn values, in fact i think it is just darkness after death, but i will buttfuck my dad in hell for eteright nowity if that is what they want to believe happens. i would hate it, but it serves his ass ""literally"" fucking right.

fuck all christians, even the ""tame, we accept you"" ones right in the fucking ass. your 2,000 year old jewish magician with a great sleight of hand for swapping bottles of water for wine has ruined my life enough. i hope there is hell, because i am fucking for sure going there, and i would not want to miss seeing my relatives regularly.

fuck this ibrahamic bullshit. i hope there is a real hell, and the only requirement to be admitted is to have ever to prayed to ""christ."" i have read the fucking bible cover to cover, forced to, and you people are are fucking going to hell. at least i get to smile over that. who knows what the fuck happens after death? i sure as fuck do not. but plenty of people i know clai am to have the 100 no-doubt sinners get singed answer.

long story short, i have dental problems. severe dental problems. i am almost out of teeth as it is, and i am getting ready to lose more because i cannot afford root canals or braces.

it started off when i needed braces when i was 17. my parents did not give a shit, so i never got them. that is fine, sucks thoughugh. fast forward to last year. i get some insurance and i am able to get 4 extra teeth out. i ampacted wisdoms and 2 canines that were supposed to be brought down off the roof of my gums with braces. got them out and i feel a lot better. i can speak withoughut a lisp now.

well. the last 6 months at the very least, the last 2 months especially, my teeth have went to shit. ever since i got all thoughse teeth out it is been a lot easier for me to take care of them. i have a top tooth on the right coright nower that is severely chipped because i could not reach it to brush or floss. it is gotten worse in the last 2 days. it is tender and it hurts. it is gotten to the root. 

i pretty much have no teeth on my left side. the last 2 teeth i have there are cavity ridden at the root and have moved around so much they are basically backwards and upside down. and last night i just chipped a huge chunk off one of my bottom teeth while i was trying to painfully eat a sandwhich.

once i got the teeth removed from before, the last few teeth i have on the left side have moved around so much there is basically no point in keeping them. i cannot afford root canals to at least save my top teeth. (i am on medicaid....)

fuck it. i am done with this. i do not know what to do. i am tired of being stressed to the point of tears. just when i put a dent in getting over my depression and feel happy again, this happens. if i do not get my teeth fixed in the next month at the very least i am going to lose them. i cannot afford anything and i have no idea what direction to head in.

fuck this, i am out.

please someone help me. i want to feel good about myself. i have fought so hard to be happy and tasted it again and now i do not even want to speak because i have no teeth. i am going to lose everything.....

433,"i feel stuck in my life and unable to do anything about it.wall of text incoming. i am not sure if anyone is going to read to the bottom. i am not sure if it matters if they do. i just wanted to get this out there.

i have pretty much had depression my whole life but it fluctuates. someti ames it gets really bad. this is one of thoughse ti ames (and it is been a while now, maybe a year and a half).i basically just feel like i cannot function.

i do not even know what is going on with university anymore. i dropped out before the end of the first semester this year. i just stopped going. i did not talk to anyone at the uni about it. they have not contacted me either.

i do not have a gp at the moment. i have been on a medical certificate for depression (for welfare purposes) before when i was like this last year but that was when i lived in a different state. i absolutely hate talking about this with anyone and it took a lot for me to go and talk about this last ti ame. the thoughught of doing it again with someone new makes me sick. i do not even know who i would talk too. my university has a health clinic but i do not even know if i am technically a student there anymore. i feel like i am frozen and i cant physically call them up or look into it. i need to go through with it to get some money from somewhere but i just feel like i *cannot*.

i have messages from people i know i should get back too but again, the thoughught of replying literally makes me want to cry. it is not that they are bad messages or anything. if i get a message on facebook or something with 'hi, what is up?' it just makes my stomach drop. usually i spend a week or so stressing over how to reply before i decide to just ignore them completely. it feels easier to cut people out of my life than to have to actually keep in contact with them. i have lost a lot of good friends that way. it terrifies me that i might lose the only couple of friends i have not destroyed my relationships with yet.  i would not want to be friends with someone who is so consistently flaky so it boggles my mind that they still reach out occasionally, even thoughugh it has been months since i have seen either of them in person. i have messages from them sitting in my inbox but i cannot bare to read them.

i have been through this before a few years ago. i dropped out of high school for a year when i was 15ish (i am 20 now). when i decided to drag myself back the next year things got so much better. i started getting good grades and realised i could actually be good at something. when i graduated, i ended getting  a scholarship to a top university in a different state. to cut a long story short, i felt alone, confused and depressed. i fucked it up. dropped out. scholarship got cancelled.

i ended up unenrolling and coming home after i got sick (pressure built up in my brain, ended up with intense headaches and dodgy sight). stayed in hospital for a little bit (unrelated to the depression). started at a university closer to home this year but i fucked that up too. i am not sure why i thoughught it would be any different this ti ame around since i still had not dealt with what made me drop out the first ti ame around.i feel like such a complete and utter failure.

i know this is a bizarre thing to say but i feel like such a non person. if someone asked me what i liked doing, or what i did for fun, or what i did for a living, i would have no answers to give them. the only thing i can think of that possibly sets me apart from any other person is the total lack of substance or anything of any value in my life. my life is basically just existing. breathing. sleeping.

i have never had a job. i do not have any hobbies. i do not have any special talents. i have never really had close friends who i see more than once a month (unless it happens by accident, eg in a school setting). i do not have any 'funny stories' about wacky things i have gotten up too. i have never been in a relationship. i have never even kissed anyone. i have never been anywhere other than my home town (besides a failed attempt at uni). i pretty much do not go out, ever. the last ti ame i went somewhere that was not the supermarket (or a fast food outlet) was probably a couple of months ago when i had a doctors appointment. going out in a social setting is even longer ago than that. i basically spend 90% of my ti ame in my room on my computer. 

i talk to people who i went to school with who have finished their degrees or just got back from backpacking around europe or have 'grown up' jobs or are engaged. i still feel 15. or like a ghost. i am not exactly sure.

i pack my day with reading and watching television shows and surfing the web. if i even think about my life for a second i feel like i am going to have a nervous break down. i do not want to have to confront my life. sitting down writing this is the first ti ame i have actively thoughught about any of this in a long ti ame. i feel like if i did not spend all day thinking about truly pointless shit i would have killed myself by now.

435,"the guy i am sort of seeing is best friends with my ex... [a bit of a rant]i do not know if i am just being overly emotional about the whole thing, but it has me feeling weird, and it is rekindled a lot of the feelings i had back when i had just broken up with hi am.

first of all, we only dated for three months or so, but i had never really connected with anyone as strongly as i did hi am, and it was the first ti ame in a very very long ti ame that i had felt truly happy. the year before my dad died, and before that i was riddled with all sorts of insecurities (about my looks, about my weight, about my intelligence, the list goes on). it was nice in so many years of dark and lonely thoughughts to have someone that just wanted to be around me, and in a lot of ways i think i felt validated, finally.

then he broke up with me. he had just gotten out of a four year relationship and was still going through some shit, but somehow i felt as thoughugh things were going naturally between the two of us. i felt after the fact that even after feeling so happy, and after feeling that someone finally got me and wanted to be around me that it was all a farce. i was left more than just dejected, i questioned whether or not i was defective somehow and constantly doomed to short relationships with abrupt and terrible endings (this 3 month relationship was also my longest, and still is).

i have never really dated anyone since, save one guy who for some unknown reason i saw fit to just sort of... phase hi am out of my life. i recently started seeing a guy, and even thoughugh he seems like he is too busy to see me anyways, i have grown a bit fond of hi am. i found out today that he is in fact best friends with this ex, and it sort of left me a little bit toright now up inside, which also sucks because lately i have been in high spirits about everything i used to be insecure about. we have not even known each other for that long, but i just feel like my ex is just a ghost that is following me around. he is got way more friends in the community than i do and everyone knows hi am and thinks he is a great guy, so it is really hard for me to really talk to anyone about how i feel about hi am. in fact, this is the first ti ame i am telling *anyone* about these feelings...

i really do not know if i am just being a little bitch about the whole thing, but i mean... i really do feel like i am somehow defective, that people can be friends with me but nothing more. i never talk about this feeling to anyone because i do not want to be a burden to any of my friends or family, because no one likes someone who talks about their sadness all the ti ame. the worst part is, i have *everything to be happy about* - i am going to grad school, i have grown out of my awkward phase and am apparently attractive, and i have been going to the gym more so i am not as husky as i used to be. but there is still that empty pitting feeling at the centre of everything... i feel like everyone else around me is happy, and they can comfortably know that they are going to find love someday, but i really do not think it is out there. i think i am doomed to just be by myself for the rest of my life, and i am scared that anyone i open up to about it is going to treat me as i really am - broken.

sorry if this is lengthy or incoherent or whatever, but i do not really know how to process any of it. i think i just needed to get it out there and talk to someone about it, because no one in my life has the ti ame or the patience to deal with me like this...",depression,depression,0.90

as part of my dissertation, i am conducting a survey in which i ask participants to listen to 18 audio clips from different invented languages—both from already published works of fiction and some i made specifically for this survey—of about 30 seconds each and to evaluate thoughse languages based on their sound. after the listening section i ask a few questions about what languages participants speak, if they have ever visited other countries, and what they know about invented languages in general.

i guess i start with how i fucked my life up. i was around my early 20's, a virgin, and just really insecure about myself and very shy, nerdy, and just generally not good socially. i was the type of guy who just stayed inside his room in his parents house just playing video games all the ti ame and smoking weed. i had severe depression back than, and it lead to me being really dumb on the interight nowet and trying to hook up with a 14 year old girl for oral sex. am i guilty? yea... stupid? yea. i really was not thinking clearly back than and i did not think it would be the big deal it became. my father met my mother when she was 14, and he was 19, and to me it was not something so sinister and perverted. i guess i was not raised the right way. anyway, i got arrested it was a sting operation and they put me on parole for life. i did not technically do anything to anyone, there was no real victi am in the situation, and everything was just a virtual cri ame. 

after that happened i sank into a deeper depression. i wanted to die, i wanted to kill myself... i never had the courage to try thoughugh. for months i just stayed inside my house because i was too scared to face all of my friends and family who knew what happened. i was incredibly ashamed of myself and just could not bear to even get up out of bed someti ames. ti ame went by and i ended up getting my court dates and all that stuff happened and when i finally was convicted and took the plea bargain i had to stay away from my family stuck in another state for over 100 days living in a dingy motel room by myself. that was even more difficult for me and i really do not know how i got through it, i wanted to die every day. during that period i never knew if i would ever be able to go back home or live in my state again due to the transfer process. 

eventually i was allowed to go home... and i went back to living with my parents and they put me on parole. i mean for the most part i have been able to put my life back together. i have a job now, i work full ti ame, i own my own home thanks to a family inheritance, and i go to the gym regularly. i have even had a few regular relationships with women and i am not a virgin anymore.

the problem is that i feel a constant sick feeling in my gut about the entire thing. i have come away with really good positive things from being on parole, but also really negative things too. habits that i am not sure id have developed if it were not for being around sex offenders and cri aminals all the ti ame. i cant tell if its the way i am personally or if its from the experiences ive gone through in my life. i have very very bad anxiety when i go to check in at parole to the point that i start shaking in fear, and also just generally being around people in society that i have to get to know whether a work relationships or friendship because i never know who will find out about my situation. i also feel trapped as if there is no way out from my parole status, and i feel that its completely unfair to be serving a life sentence when people do much worse than i did and get off parole in less than 10 years. 

i have a girlfriend right now that i am really struggling with too. i love her, and let her move into my place because she had no where to go, but i cant stand living with her. she does not really respect my house and i think she has psychological problems that lead to us having very intense arguments on a regular basis and i am worried i might hit her or these fights may cause me to get violated on parole. i have gone thoughugh 4 different parole officers because i have been on parole for so long that they keep retiring, and every ti ame i get a new parole officer it gets worse because they all enforce different rules and some of them do not care about certain things while others do. it is like my parole status is reset every ti ame i get a new po. i want to be single and be able to date other women, but i cannot kick this girl out of my house because she has no where to go and i feel terrible about it. but the relationship sucks. 

i know i sound like a piece of shit but i am really not. i made one mistake in my life and it has followed me now for over 8 years. i do not feel like the mistake i made really justifies the punishment and it is built up a lot of resentment and frustration inside of me. i act like an asshole a lot and i am not really cool to be around someti ames,  think very poorly of myself and it reflects my attitude and decisions someti ames, but someti ames it is the complete opposite and i think very highly of myself and people tell me i am always happy. i definitely feel like something is wrong with me and that i am traumatized by what i went through, but i have no one to talk to about it. i am pretty sure all of my friends do not really know what to say to me, and i cannot talk to my therapist about how i feel because it is parole therapy and they will just report it back to my po. 

i really do not even know why i am putting this here. i do not want any reddit detectives trying to figure out who i am, i just need a little guidance i guess. i have been having suicidal thoughughts again, and feeling extreme depression during the middle of the day. the gym right now is really the only thing that i have been able to keep focused on to relieve stress.",depression,suicide,0.75

485,"a copper threshing ground (медно гумно) or a copper pagan temple (медно капище) is noted in medieval writings, usually regarding danube bulgars, their political power, statehood and pagan religion. it is also mentioned (albeit rarely) in bulgarian folklore. i could not find many english sources regarding this, so here i will put down some information that i have discovered in bulgarian (there are not any sources in other languages).

the first mentions of a copper threshing ground are found in byzantine sources dating back to the ti ames when danube bulgars still existed and were pagan. joseph genesius's writings mention a threshing ground where bulgar children are killed by triumphant byzantines in the early 9th century, and in ""the letter of the three patriarchs to emperor theophilos"", the byzantine emperor leo v (ruled 813-820) is told by a man named sabbatios that if he destroys all icons, he will finally have prosperity and will stab his sword into the bulgars' copper threshing ground.

in the 10th-11th century, many christians in europe were expecting the end of the world, so apocryphal eschatological literature saw a rise. we owe several mentions of a copper threshing floor to bulgarian apocryphs. thoughse were written in the style of the biblical book of revelation or used old testament motifs, but the characters, places and symbols were often local.

in the apocryphal work ""тълкувание данаилово"" (""danail's interpretation""), a copper pagan temple is mentioned. it is linked to bulgar pagan religion by bulgarian historians and its destruction by the character михаил каган (mihail khagan, identified by some with boris i mihail) symbolizes the christianisation of bulgaria. mihail khagan goes on to fight and dethrone an ""evil king"" who abuses christians (identified with vladi amir rasate). the apocryph also describes battles in which he participated.

althoughugh pagan temples' ruins have been discovered in pliska, the capital of pagan bulgaria, copper has not been found. either the copper was stolen and the threshing floor was destroyed during invasions, or it was a metaphor.

in a different apocryph, ""видение на пророк данаил за царете, за последните дни и за края на света"" (""vision of prophet danail regarding the kings, the last days and the end of the world"") si amilar events are described, but instead of a copper pagan temple, there is a copper threshing ground. the name and title of the person who breaks the copper threshing ground are not mentioned, but he is extraordinary. wars are also noted (""brother against brother""), they might be the rebellion of the aristocraticy during the christianisation of bulgaria and the clash between vladi amir rasate and his father.

a copper threshing ground is referenced in another 11th century bulgarian medieval apocryph, ""сказание за пророк самуил"" (""слово самоилѣ прорка"", ""word regarding prophet samuel""). here, it is not linked with bulgars, but instead, it appears in nebuchadnezzar's dream and the prophet tells hi am that it symbolizes the world. it could signify what it meant to bulgars and early bulgarians - perhaps a model of the world or a symbol of the world.

as the danube bulgars assi amilated into the slavs, notions of a copper threshing ground survived in bulgarian folklore. there is a riddle that goes ""beans sown on a copper threshing ground, an old man watches over them"" and the answer is the stars, the sky and the moon. a ritual song describing an unboright now yet male child places the child on a horse that goes around a golden pole in the middle of a copper threshing ground. according to ethnologists, the horse, the copper threshing ground and the golden pole symbolize ursa minor, the sky and the polar star. according to historian marin drinov, rare mentions of copper (and metal) threshing grounds have been recorded in the folklore of other slavs, as well as in greek folklore. however, according to historian ivan venedikov, the origins of the copper threshing ground are bulgar, as there are not any notions of such a thing in greek or slavic mythoughlogy, therefore the idea must have spread in the middle ages. (mentions in macedonia in particular might be due to kuber's bulgars, but it is not proven 100%.)

however, this raises several questions.

1. how did danube bulgars come up with the copper threshing ground/copper temple? was/is there any other steppe tribe that had/has anything si amilar? i have read about volga bulgaria, but notions of a copper threshing ground/copper temple are never recorded there. both medieval bulgarian states descend from old great bulgaria, so i assume they must have had si amilarities at their founding, before they got influenced by the different religions that they converted into, by their neighbours and by the tribes that they incorporated.

2. why did it have to be copper in particular? could it be that oxidized copper turight nows turquoise and therefore reminds them of the sky and tangra? (sky also gets orange hues in sunrise/sunset, like non-oxidized copper.)

3. why did danube bulgars pick a threshing ground in particular to represent their statehood, power and pagan religion? bulgars were semi-nomadic, a threshing ground is not the first thing you had associate with a semi-nomadic people.

488,"'what does it feel like?' (trigger waright nowing)something i struggle with all the ti ame is trying to convey how it feels to be in a depressive episode to people who have never experienced it. below is my latest attempt. apologies for the length  (major trigger waright nowing).

*

it starts with something si ample; maybe a rejection, or a social faux pas, or a harsh word from someone. whatever it is, it plants a seed of self doubt in your mind that will not go away. this leads to a consistent feeling of self hatred, the feeling that you are somehow unfit or that everyone would be better off if you were not around to embarrass or annoy them; you begin to isolate yourself because of this.

the longer this isolation goes on, the more persistent the feelings of inadequacy become. it becomes harder and harder to shake the perception of yourself as an essentially worthless person. outwardly you maintain a persona, smiling, laughing, socialising, but on the inside you feel like you are slowly being ripped apart.

if you are like me, you feel very strongly that you cannot share these feelings with anyone; perhaps you are afraid that they will confirm your worst fears about yourself, or they will belittle your problems. perhaps like me, you are afraid of being stigmatised as a basket case, or having your masculinity questioned because you are a man who talks about his feelings. in any case, instead of seeking help you bottle your feelings up.

slowly and painfully, you begin to disintegrate on the inside. you push friends and family away, believing yourself to be unworthy of them or not wanting to worry them. you lose interest in things that you once loved, able only to procrastinate and wile away your ti ame abusing substances. you neglect your physical health, hygiene and work commitments; concepts like hours, days and weeks become meaningless as your life blurs into a meaningless sludge alteright nowating between when it is light and when it is dark outside. your brain seems to be fogged constantly, si amilar to the aftermath of a heavy night out, and thanks to your inability to have proper sleep you are constantly exhausted.

eventually you hit rock bottom; you sleep and eat far too little or far too much, and things such as dressing yourself or brushing your teeth become not only monumental challenges but seemingly pointless. the only thing that stops you from ending it is your fear of the act, your guilt over the consequences and your complete lack of drive or energy. you have forgotten what it feels like to experience love, joy, excitement; all that persists is the exhaustion, the anxiety, the embarrassment. 

at this point you no longer experience what it means to be human; you are a husk, a body robotically carrying out meaningless tasks. that is what depression feels like.

all i really know is that it feels like there is a thick fog in my head that stops me from doing the things i want to do, living the life i want to live, being the person i want to be.
 
i used to be the starchild of my elementary school (canadian here, elementary goes up to grade 8, when you are 13/14). i even had a best friend. i did not hang out with the ""popular"" kids nor did i belong to any particular clique but i was still very well liked and was even voted to become valedictorian. . i did not have to pretend to be anyone else. when i got into high school, i had virtually no friends. i had to cut off ties with the best friend because she was absolutely batshit and selfish. the school was very race-oriented and i ended up hanging out with the asian (and by asian, i mean chinese) clique but i never quite fit in. they never really considered me fully asian even thoughugh i am. someone once even told me they would respect me more if i were chinese. every lunch i sat awkwardly at their table while they spoke in full cantonese. every party and social gathering was the same. i always left early because i did not feel their was any point to me being there. i think we were the worst group of ""friends"" to ever exist. they even classified themselves into tiers based on their own popularity one year. 

fast forward today and they are now entering their second year of university. most of them go to the same university. i failed, hard. in short, i failed getting into my dream school twice because of my stupidity and laziness. i still hang out with the same group of people. the difference now is that they grew up to become the most materialistic people i have ever known. my town is extremely affluent - most of my friends' families own factories in china and business in hong kong. they mostly own and drive bmws while others drive lexus and mercedes. they only ever care about brand name clothing, going out to eat at fancy places, and very recently gambling. all their activities involve throwing money around and showing off their status symbols. they also smoke weed pretty much twice a day, every day. i do not hate weed but i do not think it is as harmless as everyone says it is. i smoke someti ames but i am still not super comfortable with it. every ti ame i hang out with them all i can feel and tell myself is how much i do not belong here, or how cheap my clothes are, or how if looked or acted a certain way maybe people would like me more. i never really valued material possessions until i started hanging out with them. my so tells me it is all in my head but that thoughugh does not really make me feel better because i know he is still partly wrong. they do not mean to make me feel the way i do but the fact is, i just do not quite fit in. he tells me that he hates it when i hold my feelings in but every ti ame i have told hi am how i felt, we end up in a fight and blames me for feeling the way i do. it is as thoughugh he does not really take my feelings seriously.


i always feel ugly because my friends like to focus on what makes a person ugly rather than what makes them beautiful. someone does not have a typically skinny asian girl body? fatass. a pi ample? disgusting. one guy calls me ""love handles."" they call another girl ""thunder thighs"" behind her back. they say they are joking but i know they really do think i am think i am too fat around the hips or that the other girl's legs are too thick. the sad part is i have got a bmi of 17.6 and that girl is 20.0 max. 

i know it is easy to meet people at school or work but the college i went to did not have any such thing as frosh week and virtually no one lived on campus. everyone was friendly but we were all competing against each other to get into the same program (ours was kind of like a pre-program) so there was little ti ame to socialize. of course, i am a loser who got rejected from said program so i have nowhere to go. as for work, i have applied to literally countless places only to never hear from them. my town is dominantly chinese so speaking the language is usually required or a major asset.

i hate it here. everyone in this town is the exact same with the exact same attitude towards people who are different and exact same goals. every ti ame i go on facebook i just get depressed from looking at pictures of other people enjoying their lives while i am having a shitty ti ame. i am just some nerd who likes to play video games, listen to music, and make art. every ti ame i leave this town i feel a slight peace of mind and every ti ame i come back all i think about is how unhappy i am. i am a natural extrovert - i love to talk and meet new people but when it comes to this town i am the exact opposite. i love going to conventions i feel like i do not have to hold myself back. i enjoy staying at home more than going out because i do not have to prove anything to anyone when i am alone and i do not have to face judgement.

i do not really have anyone to talk to. i am distant from my parents. my parents divorced for the better when i was in grade 8 and my dad is not quite sound of mind but that is another story. i used to have tons of people to talk to but eventually i began to lose trust in everyone. i used to feel like i did not need anyone else and that i could get myself out of this hole if i really tried but i really tried and i am still here and i am afraid that my depression or whatever it is has taken control of my life. i had a dog and he really helped but when he died i just hated myself even more. i do not like getting close to people here because they have either got some sort of ulterior motives or are just downright uninteresting and i hate myself for thinking this way. i hate myself for being so negative all the ti ame. i wish i could be more accepting of other people. 
i know this is extremely long and i apologize. but if you read it all, thank you so much, because you had be one of the only people ever who bothered to listen.

tl;dr i hate my town and have no one to talk to about my insecurities.

i have a plan thoughugh. i would restart my life instead of sending it. i would move and possibly detach myself from everyone who has ever been in my life. if not that, drugs to stop me from suicide.

i have thoughught about suicide on plenty of occasions, but it is mainly just fantasizing. i think about how people would respect my death as a tragedy, i would be a high schooler with a decent future who died young, not some 40-something who never amounted to anything. part of that probably comes from me just wanting attention, i do not think i would ever actually pull the trigger. or maybe i am just a coward, who knows.

i used a lot, it started in 7th grade when i would get depressed when my parents were not home, i would drink up their stash of liquor they never used until i was in a stupor. one ti ame they actually came home to find me puking in the shower, but i somehow convinced them that i ate some bad chicken (they might have known but i would think they would have been furious if that were the case). that continued into about 9th grade and then i stopped doing it regularly. every once in a while i will have drinking binges but they are really not that frequent.

* family member dies. develop self worth issues. main issue feeling that i failed the person who died and that i could have done more for her. would not even do the most basic things for her even thoughugh we moved next door to her. was too sad to see her like she was, only after she died did i realize i was a dumbass and that she gave a leg to watch me grow up and stop paying attention to her. fuck. fuck. fuck.

* give up on self. stop applying myself in school. stop playing sports. stop doing lots of things. become introverted. i do find it really easy to be open around friends i have had since before family member's death, but cannot open up to new people withoughut a week or two of them knowing and talking to me. family takes shift in behavior as a video game thing.

* changes mostly go unnoticed due to the whole ""being happy when i am around people thing."" many night spent crying myself to sleep.

* move to a new town for college.

* fail to get job in new town

* fail to make hardly any new friends in new town.

* have trouble applying self in college, fail out. later get back in due to second chance program. whatever, i know i am a failure.

* move off of campus and in with ""friend"" who lives there. he is more former friend at the moment.

* during second chance of semester, ""friend"" starts telling me to get a job, which i am trying to do. college town and all, not really lots of open places during the semester. verbal put downs from ""friend"" begin.

* move out of ""friend"" house and into house with a real friend from old town. ""friend"" is mutual acquaintance. still hangs out. still finds ways to verbally put me down. ""getaway does not have a job. needs to do something productive with his life"". ""getaway has no excuse for not wanting to do anything. he does not have a job."" shit like that.

* secretly drop out of school. still a secret from everyone that the semester was a withdraw.

__________________________________________________________

* move to new town to avoid ""friend"". occasionally have to go back to do some game events. ""getaway does not have a job or is in school this semester. how do you live with yourself?/needs to do something with his life/etc etc.

* still no job yet. still getting rejection letters after interviews. 

* tried to talk about this with parents, but could only brush the surface. they say there is nothing wrong with me and that i should see a methoughdist councilor at most, but i want a real councilor/therapist. 

* no new friends yet still. just the two here from school. 

* hardly leaving house. friend roommate is starting to find it weird.

yeah. where should i go from here? most nights are like tonight. attempted sleep followed by bad thoughughts followed by ti ame killing to get my mind off of it. repeat until it is moright nowing. ever since family member has died, i have found it hard to communicate or think clearly. 

starting to stutter/randomly forget words/stop mid sentence/physically loosing things/putting stuff in weird places (yesterday i put a plate in the fridge instead of in the cabinet after doing the dishes. did not catch it until today.).

would that be from the family member dying, or would that be the probably undiagnosed concussion i had from playing basketball? who knows.

i am still putting myself down at almost every opportunity. denying myself happiness. i have even sabotaged some job interviews because other people probably deserve it more than me/i would just fuck it up. still having sleepless nights/crying myself to sleep. i have had suicidal thoughughts, but i am unsure if i would ever act on them at all at this point.",depression,depression,0.90

525,"i feel like a fraudi went through a bad ti ame this last year and it created crazy anxiety. i spent everyday, all day in a sense of panic. i was waking up in the night to panic attacks, taking sleeping tablets to sleep, not eating - because of bad experiences. i went to the doctor and told them what i was feeling, hoping for some counselling to help. they diagnosed me as severely depressed and anxious and started me on citalopram. 

at first it did not help and now it is been about 5 weeks since i started it and i had a really good weekend. i have not felt this okay in a while. so now i am questioning if it was really all real. is it just the meds working or is it because my relationship that ended has now started back up so i was not alone all weekend drowning in my own thoughughts, i was distracted.

i am just really confused, do you guys have happy periods then question if it is all real? i read on here about people who have been depressed for life and have no reason to be. i just worry i am a fraud and it is just because i have had a really hard ti ame lately. do any of you question if it is real?",depression,depression,0.90
526,"i feel so alone, like no one cares about mei have felt depressed for quite a while althoughugh i do not know if i am truly depressed. i just feel like i am not wanted where i thoughught i was. every girl i have ever liked has harshly rejected me in ways i thoughught were not possible. i feel like people do not support me of approve of what i want to be, and who i am right now. i feel like no one has ever really cared about me. i am 15 and on the bus rides home i always look at that one girl who i like (she never notices) and i wonder ""why does she think i am not right for her"". i always ask myself why does no one ever think i am worthy of being either in their friend groups or even to be with them. i always wonder what it is about me that people do not like. am i too annoying? am i too sad? am i too ugly? am i just that one person who just did not fit anywhere? i had to switch between countless friends in middle school and i had to endure relentless bullying through out elementary. and now that i am a sophomore i feel like nothing has changed. i have considered suicide multiple ti ames and used to cut. i stopped and i thoughught things got better. then that one girl rejected me so hard, i just fell on my knees and could not get back up. my personality changed, my hobbies changed, i am more judgemental, and i feel more alone than ever. i do not know where these emotions are coming from, and i do not know who to talk to them about. i hate talking to counselors and teachers, and i hate talking to my parents. i felt like at least my parents would care, but then they just took everything i had ever had a passion for away after they knew i was suicidal for a brief ti ame. i feel like that worsened my mood and now i just feel alone. i do not know what to do, and i wish i did. i wish i had that one person who i could just cuddle with and talk my feelings but i do not think that will ever happen. so now based on these feelings, i have only one question: who would care if i killed myself today. it already seems like no one cares, so what point is there to live for. feeling lonely and sad, and having my hopes and dreams stripped from me is not how i want to feel or live. so what loss is there for others to have if i am just gone? i highly doubt anyone has ""secret"" feelings for me. i highly doubt people will even notice i am gone. so why am i here? what purpose do i serve? and what will i lose when i am gone?

528,"feel as thoughught i am letting everyone down/a burdenlately i have felt that life is not worth living.

i am a 21 year old male at college with a girlfriend, friends a job and a rather loving family.
but i hate my life and just want it to end. i am failing my course because i am too fucking dumb and i cannot bring myself to put in the effort.

my girlfriend loves me and i have a good amount of close friends but seeing them brings me no joy. 
i am close to being outed as a failure to my parents and i do not know what they will do when they find out.
all i feel is anxiety - like i am constantly on the verge of a panic attack. 
i just want to go back to a ti ame when i did not have so much pressure on myself. i cannot handle people's expectations.

i think about suicide every single day, probably every single hour. whenever something bad happens, no matter how minor, i feel an instant compulsion to just shoot my head off.
i cannot go on like this, because i cannot see pulling myself out of this slump of no motivation and no aspiration. 

i just want it to end. i always told myself that if i ever felt like killing myself i would run away from home first. like, pack some stuff and get on a flight, or drive to another state and see what happens.
but now that i am in a position to contemplate that, i will not even do it.
no money, no real desire to see any more of the world. so i figure i should just kill myself.
and i know it will be bad for my family and friends, but honestly, their grief is not quite enough of a deterrent. 

i want to be happy, but i do not think i can, and i cannot go on like this.

i just want to start this off with that my childhood have been like hell for me, i have never been liked by many people and have always had the role as the ""silent guy withoughut friends"". i even experienced a lot of physical abuse.

and now i am currently 21 years old with 2-3 friends, and i have a pretty decent job as a trainee atm.

but the thing is that for some years now i seem to become more depressed, even if i hang out with my friends... i just keep checking my phone for someone to ask me to join playing some video games or hang out somewhere. but it never happens, i just sit there waiting for someone to take contact.

lately i even lost some friends i loved a lot because my stupid depresson and me being anti social... i cant even seem to get a girlfriend since i am not attractive enough.

at the moment my life only consist of one person that i have known since childhood and my parents. i no longer even go outside my house due to me thinking that people judge me when they look at me... i have even started thinking of self-harm and worse lately and i am not sure what to do...

if anyone got any tips i will greatly appreciate it, i do not really like talking about this at all since i do not want to trouble other people with my personal problems.

i just cant see that this will get any better in the future, it feels like if i continue this i will be stuck in this endless loop forever...

539,"one thing i have learight nowed recently: nobody is too busy unless they choose to be.
think about it—some of the busiest people in the world do not even describe themselves as “busy.” why? because they plan, they prioritize, and they know what matters.

someti ames, we stay “busy” because it feels safer than slowing down.

ask yourself:

is your packed schedule a form of avoidance?

does being busy make you feel more i amportant?

does it give you a reason to say ""no"" to people or plans you had rather avoid?

are you using “busy” as a shield from your own emotions?


if planning and scheduling feels unmanageable, start with this si ample habit:
each moright nowing, write down your top 5 essential tasks.
focus on only thoughse. no guilt. no extra fluff. just progress.

let us also confront the emotional side of busyness. someti ames, we cling to full calendars because they give us a sense of worth. instead, let us build genuine confidence by:

creating things we are proud of

getting better at something we love

setting clear boundaries in relationships

giving ourselves permission to rest


busyness does not equal value. clarity does. focus does. being aligned with your goals does.

so i am curious… what is your relationship with being busy?
are you learight nowing to slow down, or still stuck in the cycle?
let us have an honest discussion—how do you manage your ti ame, energy, and priorities?

share your experiences, tips, or even struggles. we are all figuring this out together.

540,"spilling it outfirst off, i do not expect much of spilling this out here. probably because i do not expect much of anything anymore. i am the person who is invisible in a crowd- literally and figuratively. there is nothing about me worth remembering. my self worth has never peaked above insignificant. what makes me feel worse about this all, is that i have absolutely zero reason to feel this way, and that possibly is the reason i have always been frustrated with this emotion for as long as i can remember. 

i am a healthy person, i have a decent paying job where i have been promoted several ti ames. i can afford to split a nice apartment in a nice area with my girlfriend who i think i want to marry one day. i can afford most things i want, and i generally do not struggle with anything except in my own head. growing up i have always wanted a struggle, a hardship, a rock bottom that you see in movies, hear in songs, read in books. i have never had one. on one hand i am glad- i have great parents who i treasure and who have taught me so much about the world and never gave me anything and taught me to earight now my place in life. i used to i amagine how i would handle life if i did not have them or if i lost them at some point in my childhood. i used to think that some adversarial interdiction would make me better in some form or fashion.

my struggle is completely interight nowal. i have very little drive- despite the fact that i continue to get promoted for my company, this is not what i want as a career and it never was. i feel like i am on a path that will take me so far away from something else that i will be stuck. other than the aspirations when i was little to be a police officer or a firefighter or the president or a professional baseball player- i have never felt the drive to do anything really... any possible career path i can shoot down i ammediately with why i cannot do it. probably in an effort to stop myself from trying and failing and then feeling like shit because i am inadequate. 

i never really had a drive to go to college. i was the b student who never had to try. i could remember most information and never really applied myself. i applied to umass at the last minute because it was local and all of my friends were going to school so i did not want to be different. i started going for computer engineering, but because i did not have the study skills from just coasting my entire educational career i constantly flunked out of courses. after being suspended due to academics i went to a community college where i got my associates in psychology. since i got my associates- i was allowed back at umass and i continued along the path and tried to earight now a bachelors in liberal arts with concentrations in psychology and sociology. not a bad path right? well i had and have no desire to be in these fields. i took them because they were the classes that i thoughught i could pass and i did not want my parents to be disappointed at their son. i spent 7 years total in college and i dropped out because i just could not push myself anymore. my parents, friends and girlfriend think i graduated and no ones the wiser. 

i feel like my two friends and i are growing further apart. as we get into our late 20s my best friend has been in multiple relationships- you know the type- where they all but disappear but for a couple text messages, which is great for hi am if he is happy. even thoughugh i am in my own relationship i cannot help but feel left behind twiddling my thumbs. my other friend is never really around when i am- because i work retail my hours do not exactly gel with the normal m-f 9-6. the ti ames i used to go out with them and their larger group of friends were some of the most depressing ti ames i can think of. they are all incredibly smart- in the medical field, high iqs, successful jobs and i just cannot compete at all. i know from the outside the standard thoughught is that i do not have to have a high paying job like them to get along, but they are all in the medical field and i cannot get into the conversation so i feel left behind so i do not bother showing up anymore and they have stopped inviting me since i stopped showing up.

i see a lot of posts on here about appearance, and there are days i feel fine about mine, but most i do not. i am extremely short and thin to the extent people make comments that i look like a skeleton. i must have an extremely aggressive metabolism because i can eat like a house and not gain a pound. because of my metabolism i would have to eat 3500-4000 calories a day to gain some muscle mass which i have given up on trying. i would get up at 5:30 every moright nowing and go to the gym but after a year of seeing no results i quit. what is the point? i thoughught i made strides using some subli aminal psychology about all this. i took a notebook and on each page- i wrote something i hated about myself. my arms are too small, i am too short, my face is shaped funny, i am not funny, i have no talent, etc... i set the notebook by my closet door so that every moright nowing i could get up and get dressed and physically move past all of my perceived inadequacies. seemed nice in thoughught but i have over thoughught it to the point that it does not mean anything anymore. i have no talent- no career prospects, which is aggravating because i want out of my field. i am tired of what i am doing and i just have no other viable options. 

i am the type that thinks about suicide but will never do anything about it. i am too much of a pussy. i do not think suicide is selfish, but my depression is my burden. so much so that it is keeping me alive. 

i have thoughught about driving my car off the highway- but i do not because i do not want to accidentally hurt someone else in the meanti ame. i do not want to take pills because i do not want to waste the pills... what if they could help someone else and i am taking them away. i do not want to inconvenience someone with the aftermath that i would create- no matter how small a footprint i leave

what if when i hurt myself- the emts could be potentially helping someone else that deserves helping?

i do not want to hurt my family emotionally or hurt my girlfriend emotionally because i know they do love me. 

i am aggravated because i am taking up space and resources in a world where i do not deserve them. someone else should have my clothes, my car, my apartment. someone else deserves them. my girlfriend deserves someone better than me, who can provide for her better than me, who can make her happier than i can. 

i am sitting here on my day off, getting messages about work and how i cannot keep staff so i will be going back to working 7 days a week soon. it is a rainy day and my girlfriend is at work. i asked if my two friends were around. one might be but since i am so damn indecisive i have no idea what to propose to do.  i feel like posting this is not even a cry for help. it is just for attention. having read countless other posts, i know that i am inconveniencing you- the reader who has the best of attention to read and post something that could possibly help. but you are reading my post- the inadequate- who does not deserve it. you could be helping someone else in the ti ame it is taken to read this.

* succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in parkinsons patients, etc.)
* give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year ph.d. student?
* provide links to comments you have made in askscience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  applications will not be approved withoughut several comments made in /r/askscience itself.

i am so lonely. so incredibly lonely. if i am being honest with myself, these past few weeks have actually gone somewhat decently, at least when comparing them to what my life was like before, that is. i still struggle with anxiety, but am slowly becoming more open with people. the problem is, no one cares to listen to what i have to say.

i attempt to start conversations with people and fail miserably. if i am not the first to speak up, i am outright ignored - i may as well not exist at all. honestly speaking, it would not surprise me if no one at my school remembered my name, outside of my teachers and counselors.

confidence cannot hide the fact that i am an ugly, socially awkward mess of a person. i go outside trying to make *somewhat* of a good i ampression, but still look hideous and moronic despite my effort. my face and body are unsightly, and i know that, realistically speaking, i have to put in more effort to get people to notice me, which so far, i have failed at.

one of my problems is that i am completely and utterly boring. i have no interests or traits that define me as a person. if people were asked to choose a word that described me, they would be at a loss, outside of perhaps ""fat"" or ""stupid"". recovering from depression has made me want to regain my hobbies, but it is i ampossible to do so with a lack of money. i am a jobless teenager with parents that make mini amum wage and have to try and support me, themselves, and my little brother using it, so we do not exactly have a lot of extra cash to spare. i recently mentioned an interest in guitar, but i do not think my mom nor my dad took me seriously, which is probably for the best anyhow. last ti ame i tried to learight now playing an instrument, it ended badly.

even online i am generally ignored. i have no reason for social media because there is nothing for someone like me to post. like i mentioned before, i have zero interests, and most of my day is spent on reddit, assuming i am not at school or binging on food.

i do not even know why i bother trying to talk to people anymore because nobody i have spoken to has cared. i am socially inept and recently i have tried to make myself accept that i am going to have to live the rest my life extremely lonely, which is something i currently do not know how to cope with. i guess some people just are not fit for socialising, and i am an example of one of them. i just wish i knew how to deal with it.",depression,depression,0.90

i am in my first year at university and its been great, i love the independence and all the new friends i have met. but one my new friends (i have known her for about 5 months now) has started to open up to me about how shes been feeling when we ride the bus away from campus together.

she would been seeming really down for a while now; sad eyes, withdrawn when talking, leaving by herself. one day when we were on the bus together i asked her why she seemed so miserable. at first she did not say anything but after a period of silence she told me shes been feeling really shitty and she told me she was a bad friend. she will not give me exact reasons but i think its to do with unrequited love with someone in our group. in the hope of helping her and because i trust her i told her that i had been depressed and that i would try and help her.

the problem? every ti ame i talk to her or look at her i see myself when i was depressed. she has the same manners, attitude and reasons that i did and i am scared by how much i relate to her. i know i cannot abandon her but i am starting to feel her sadness weighing on me and its taking me back to when i was depressed.

a few days ago, i wrote about the power of controlling our thoughughts, how shifting focus can change everything. but i have realised it is not easy for everyone. from the comments and discussions, i understood that mastering thoughught control takes practice, meditation, and discipline.

it was overthinking that made me realise the power of controlling my thoughughts. it drained me, kept me awake the whole night, until i decided to take control of my mind.

but here's the twist...what if overthinking is not the enemy? what if it is actually a superpower we just do not know how to use properly?

think about it. overthinking is not just thinking too much, it is deep thinking. and deep thinking can lead to creativity, problem-solving, and personal breakthroughs. the real problem is not overthinking itself...it is how we approach it.

i amagine two people looking at the same glass with half of water in it.
       one sees it as “half-full” (opti amistic)
       other sees it as “half-empty” (pessi amistic).

overthinking works the same way. it can either:.       
       trap us in fear, doubt, and inaction (negative loop).
       push us toward insights, solutions, and creativity (productive loop).

so instead of fighting overthinking, what if we learight nowed to channelize it into something productive? what if we turight nowed it into a tool for innovation, self-awareness, and growth?

have you ever turight nowed overthinking into something positive

[click here to view that announcement which has been approved and locked for posterity](https://redd.it/14eox9x).

2. a tug-of-war between the u/moderatorcodeofconduct account and the remaining moderators ensued, with the post repeatedly being removed and reinstated. each mod involved was i ammediately locked out of reddit. subreddit settings were also unilaterally changed by the admin account.

3. eventually, all moderators were removed and suspended for 7 days, with the vote results deleted and the community set to “archived.” 

4. a lot of public outrage ensued, with details posted on r/modcoord about what happened. at that point, no other subreddit had been targeted yet, leaving the situation uniquely unclear.

5. admin cited actions as an ""error"" and promised to work with us to solve the situation. for /r/mildlyinteresting posterity, this will henceforth be referred to as the mistake trade_mark .

6. all our accounts were unsuspended and reinstated, but only with very li amited permissions (modmail access only). for what it is worth, 'ti ame moderated' for every moderator was reset (e.g. /u/redsquaree moderated since 11 years ago, reset: currently showing moderated since ""1 day ago"").

7. the awaited discussion never happened. instead, the admins presented us with an ulti amatum: reopen the subreddit and do not mark it as nsfw, or face potential removal again. the inconsistent and arbitrary application of reddit is policies reveals a possible conflict of interest in maxi amizing ad revenue at the risk of user safety and community integrity.

8. finally, our moderation permissions were restored after we ""promised"" to comply with their conditions, but we kept the subreddit restricted while we ponder our next steps..

problems remain unresolved, and reddit is approach to policies and communication have been troubling. we believe open communication and partnership between reddit and its moderators are crucial for the platform's success.

as a team, we remain dedicated to protesting reddit is careless policy changes. removing ourselves or vandalizing the subreddit will not achieve our goals, but rather hinder our community. we are here to ensure r/mildlyinteresting is not left unattended.

we call for the establishment of clear, structured, and reliable communication channels between reddit admins and moderation teams. teams should be informed and consulted on decisions affecting their communities to maintain trust and integrity on the platform. we shared this request with the admin who promised to work with us, so far they have ignored it. 

us mods are still deciding how exactly to reopen, not that we have been given much choice.

sincerely,

the r/mildlyinteresting mods",noise,noise data,0.95
591,"in the us, the life expectancy for men boright now is 2023 was 75.8 years for men and 81.1 years for women—a difference of 5.3 years. this “longevity gap,” which was two years in 1900, grew to nearly eight around 1980 before dropping to its current level.

interestingly, the gap shrinks among older men and women — a 65-year old man in 2023 was expected to live another 18.2 years, and a woman could expect another 20.7 years. why this smaller gap? more men die before age 65, dragging men's life expectancy at birth down. thirty-one percent of men who died in 2023 were below 65, compared to 19% of women.

if you just read this and started contemplating your mortality, i have weird news: the social security administration has what they call a “[life expectancy calculator](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/population/longevity.html)” but what some folks might call a “death clock”. i have not tried it yet, and i really do not want to, but i probably will anyway.

• wife told me she wanted a divorce out of the blue one moright nowing. 
• as a result my finances have been spinning out of control and i am currently being sued by at least one creditor. the majority of my debt (~$300k) is educational debt and filing bankruptcy would not even get rid of it. 
• i had to move back in with my parents. my mom is bi-polar and my dad is a recovering alcoholic who is prone to relapses. 
• in the past month, i have had to put down my dog i have had for 16 years withoughut getting to say goodbye because i lost hi am in the divorce, my cousin passed away from cancer, and my favorite uncle died unexpectedly. 
• i have a gf and when it is good it is great but she is super moody and i find myself wondering if she is gaslighting me a lot of the ti ame. whenever i complain about how she is treating me she turight nows it around or tells me i am being too sensitive. her family is amazing but i just never know what will set her off. at this point i am more afraid to lose them than her. 
• i should point out that my mom hates my gf and makes my life a living hell for dating her. 

the only thing keeping me alive is my children. otherwise i would have checked out. i am sitting here watching them sleep as i write this and i am just crying. they are literally all i have in this world. i am living in constant dread that i am suddenly going to be homeless and have even less access to my children.

some explanation about why i am asking this.
i am new to this sub. i have been struggling with bouts of depression mostly because of  big hormonal swings. i am a girl and get really depressed to the point i want to kill myself during my periods. lately life has been very hard i am a always tired and it is so so hard to get out of bed. i am angry a lot and get into fights with my boyfriend. really almost test hi am out and push hi am away and be able to say 'see you do not really love me'.  my depression has been far worse thoughugh. i have been in therapy for over a year now and it has greatly helped.

to battle the hormonal swings i switched to an iud but i got very bad hairloss from this and as a 23 year old woman i did not want to go bald over having the wrong hormones in my body. so i guess it is quite vain in a way but i had them take it out. thankfully my hair is growing back now.

anyway that brings me to the point where my psychologist adviced me to maybe start on a very low dosage of citalopram start with 5mg a day and then 10mg a day. to level out the super highs and the super lows. i am not quite sure what i want.

627,"this is my last night on earthhi sw,

i am a 19-year-old college sophomore at a really expensive, exclusive, liberal arts college in the northeast. i know that it is a great privilege to be able to attend a school like this and i have completely wasted it. i had an editorial position on the school newspaper and i had three jobs and a tutoring position and i have managed to lose them all due to my own inefficacy as a human being. i am also in a useless major that i thoughught i loved, but now i hate. i have not gone to class in a week and i have done barely any work all semester. i hate being the type of person who does this and i hate having to make up excuses all the ti ame to myself and to other people. i always thoughught it might be cool to become a doctor or an architect or something else but i would have to start completely over and my family has gone completely bankrupt sending me to this expensive college for two years and i cannot live with myself for doing that to them. i do not really want to kill myself but i do not have any options left. i used to have friends here but they have all either left the school or left me. i cannot drop out for the semester because my parents have already paid for it. but i cannot keep living like a shut in. i do not do anything except go on the interight nowet and sleep. it might be easier to get through this if i had any sort of job prospects or future whatsoever but i know if i survive until the summer i will just be back at the same horrible mini amum wage job i had last year and then after that i will have to go back here and graduate and i still will not have any future then. i cannot stay here, i cannot leave, and there is no way that i can change anything. i do not want to kill myself, but i do not think i have any other options that do not involve screwing my family over. i have already screwed myself over.

the sad thing about my major is that i am really good at it. i am a creative writing and poetry major, and i am the only 19 year old i know who has been published in multiple interight nowational jouright nowals. i have received honors in every writing class i have taken. i have two separate pieces being published in two jouright nowals this march and that is exciting and all but it is not enough to keep me here when everything else is so terrible. i mean it is something i love but i should not have made it my major. i hate the types of people who call themselves poets. so fucking pretentious and full of shit and competitive and dehumanizing.

i have a bottle of whiskey and there is a bridge nearby. i think tomorrow i am going to call my family and some friends and set things in order and then tomorrow night, i will be dead. thinking about that is so glorious. it is such a relief. i did not want it to come to this, but i cannot even feel pain right now. i have never felt like this before. i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt when i was seventeen but what i was feeling then was nothing compared to this. i had so much ahead of me then. it is surprising how much i could fuck that up in two years.

i feel really bad about doing this to my parents. i feel like depriving them of a daughter is worse than depriving them of all the money and ti ame they have wasted in raising me, somehow. but i hope they will understand that it is better for me to just end it now before it gets worse.

i might stay in and call a doctor tomorrow. i am not sure. obviously i have not completely made my mind up yet or else i would not be posting here. i do not even know who i would call, because i am not on the college insurance plan. i just do not know how much treatment can do for me. it can help me maybe in the short term but i do not think it will make an eventual difference. somehow that seems worse.

630,"thinking about getting help, have some questionsmy suicidal thoughughts have worsened a lot over the past few weeks and while i still feel like i do not want to commit suicide the temptation is constantly there and i am becoming increasingly conceright nowed that i might do it in a moment of weakness. i have already had one close call and would like to avoid another.

i think i might finally be ready to try to get some help for my depression but i have a few questions/conceright nows first. 

1) how would i even go about trying to get myself checked into a hospital? i do not want to wait for a doctor's appointment but i also think it would be incredibly awkward for a perfectly (physically) healthy person to just walk into an er and try to convince them that i need help.

2) if i was admitted to the hospital, is it possible to keep it completely secret from everybody (family, employers etc.)? i am 24 and still live with my parents but i do not want them or anybody else in my family to know about my depression. i am staying at somebody else's house for the next week so i was thinking maybe this would be  a good chance for me to go to the hospital withoughut anybody noticing, assuming i am not in there for any more than a few days.

3) what would/could it cost, if anything (i live in canada by the way)? i have got no money right now so i would not be able to pay any charges.

sorry if these are dumb questions. i have not even seen a doctor since i was a little kid so i am completely clueless about how any of this works. any information or advice anybody can give me would be greatly appreciated.

i dated this girl my last year in college for about 9 months. she was like the exact opposite of me - i was liberal, atheist, shy/antisocial; she was conservative, religious, in a sorority. despite the differences, we were really happy together. eventually with our graduations looming and mostly my stubboright nowness, we split up and i took it pretty hard. but i made a promise to myself to become a better person. i started working out, focusing on trying to i amprove my social/fashion skills, working on being more tolerant/openminded, etc. and to an extremely large extent, i feel i succeeded. one night, i was drunk and facebook messaged her kind of just saying hey and hoping that she was doing better. she ended up coming over and staying the night. slowly we started talking again via text, pretty much every day. her texts were always the highlight of my day. i am working in ks as a chemist, and she is moved to atlanta, ga for an interight nowship. we start to talk about life goals and how we have changed, etc. and it slowly evolves into a 'hey, you know, we seemed to be much more in line with each other now, maybe there is a possibility this could work this ti ame'. and the senti ament is mutual. i plan a trip to fly down and visit her this past weekend, with the intent of laying the formation for a slow, but potentially great recovery and loving relationship.

friday night, i get in and we go out drinking. we are being really flirty and having a great ti ame then she just disappears. so now i am alone in a bar in a foreign land and super confused. after 45 minutes of looking for her, i find her in the backseat of her car with some random guy. she does not even know his name, and they are clothed, but i flip out. she says it is not what it looks like, etc etc. we go back to her place, have angry sex, and pass out. in the moright nowing we talk about it; she says she was scared/nervous about me being there, and this is her way of pushing people away when they get close. she says she loves me and wants to be with me, but does not think she can offer me what i want/deserve from her. i play the role of the nice guy and say ""alright, well, let us do some sight seeing and rent a movie and take it easy tonight, my flight leaves in the moright nowing."" she thinks that is a great idea and she gets in the shower. while she is showering, i am laying there and i kind of freak out. i sit up, think to myself ""no, i am sick of being a good guy and letting girls walk all over me"". so i start to pack my stuff up to head to the airport and leave early. she gets out and asks me what is wrong, and i respectfully let her have it. i tell her that what she did is not okay, and that i came down here with what i felt like was a mutual interest in pursuing a meaningful relationship only to have her pull some insane stunt that hurt me more than i can put into words. she cries and apologizes, and i give her every chance to stop me from leaving, but she does not. i walk to the door, withoughut turight nowing to look at her say ""i hope you get everything you want in life"" and walk out. after walking for 45 min trying to figure out where the hell i am to call a cab, i find a mcdonalds and start looking up cab numbers on my phone. she calls me. she asks me to come back and talk to her and stay. i comply. we kind of lounge around at her apt for the rest of the day, rent a movie and snuggle and watch it, then go to bed (no sex). we wake up, she takes me to the airport and i leave. she texts me after i leave telling me that she loves me and she is sorry, she just does not think she can give me what i want right now, and that she wants to be with me and that she needs me to be a part of her life. i tell her that i wish i could understand that. i tell her that i need some ti ame away from talking to her for a while to try and figure out what i need to do.

i do not know what to do. i feel like my entire motivation to keep waking up and going to work is gone now. i think there is a part of her that wants what i want - the ""well, i am an adult now and i want to settle down and share my life with someone"" stage but i also think she is not completely out of that ""i am young and want to party and meet people and be crazy"" stage either. i do not want to let her go, but i do not want to wait around to be the consolation prize because i might be waiting for nothing. she has always had psychological issues, she is been suicidal/a self mutilator in the past, and i think she is dealing with some of that stuff right now, so i do not want to leave her to deal with that alone, but i cannot let myself be dangled along. i guess i just do not know what to do and do not know how to keep on keeping on. i know this was long, but thanks for reading.",SuicideWatch,depression,0.75

our magnetic north pole has moved more in recent years than in recorded history, it now floats around siberia, our cli amate is changing and has been changing even more rapidly since 2017 when the pole shifted over 300 miles. if you pay attention to the jet streams in our atmosphere and the ""unusual"" storms that are occurring across the globe, they actually line up with where they would be if we were orbiting via em.

i went to uni and instantly it hit me. i was alone in a hall of 12 people who were mostly foreign exchange students who had no interest in doing anything and stuck to their close groups. two people in my flat tried to kill themselves and i did too. i tried to go out on my own and meet people but i got harassed and touched up by a guy the first ti ame and felt so low that nobody would talk to me the second ti ame. after trying to kill myself and being unable to sleep for five days, i had help through a psychiatrist, doctor, counsellor and early intervention team. but it didnt change how i felt. i ended up quitting uni.

639,"hello dear viewers , today i am sharing the recipe for some delicious homemade burger buns , the same ones i used for chicken burgers in my last post. you can also make them withoughut the eggs. 
this recipe is apt for making 6 buns. 

ingredients:

1. 225g/  of all-purpose flour, which is roughly 1 1/2 cups.

2. 1 egg. just one egg will do the trick.

3. 10 ml / 2 tsp oil, you can use any type of oil you prefer. i used ev olive oil. use 35 ml oil if you want them eggless.

4. 30g / 2 tbsp sugar, we will need a bit of sweetness to balance out the flavors.

5. 15g/1 tsp of blocked yeast, make sure to crumble it into small pieces before using. if you are using active dry yeast then use 11.25g. 

6. 170ml/3/4 cups of water.
we will need this to activate the yeast and bring the dough together.

7. sesame seeds for topping (optional)
 

procedure:

take the blocked yeast and crumble it into small pieces. then, mix it with 170ml of warm water. let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy and bubbly.

while the yeast is activating, let us mix the dry ingredients together. in a large bowl, combine the ap flour , sugar, and a pinch of salt. mix well until everything is fully incorporated.

next, add the egg and oil to the dry ingredients. mix until the dough starts to come together.

now it is ti ame to add the yeast mixture. gradually pour it into the dough and mix until everything is fully incorporated.

knead the dough for 10-15 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic. you can use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment or knead it by hand.

place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.

once the dough has risen, punch it down to release any air bubbles. divide it into 6 equal portions, each weighing around 80g.

shape each portion into a round. place the shaped dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving about 1 inch of space between each bun.

brush the tops of the buns with a little water or egg wash, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.

cover the dough with a clean towel and let it proof in a warm, draft-free place for 30-45 minutes, or until it has doubled in size again. 
if you are looking for some perfectly round buns then use a stainless-steel baking rings.

preheat your oven to 180°c. place the baking sheet with the dough into the preheated oven and bake for 12 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown.

remove the buns from the oven, brush them with some oil while they are cooling, and then let them rest for at least 15-20 minutes. ",noise,noise data,0.95

i am in a rental but am also a professional painter. landlord keeps rent low so i have painted all three bedrooms for hi am both for free, as well as because this is where i am raising my baby and want the paint to stay on the wall (it was chipping off).
     that to say, i have pretty free rein to do stuff, and i will also likely need to dismantle it and do some repairs when i move out some years from now. when i moved in, landlord had great stuff foam sealing the doorway closed. 

so, cut to fit soundboard? what is the best way to attach that? any other options? whatever it takes to dismantle this, i will not have a problem doing the repairs necessary to put things back together. au pair will be here one year with both parties having the option to extend it to two years. we will almost certainly have an au pair living there a mini amum of two years even if we do not extend this particular person. strong possibility of several years of an au pair living in this room. small possibility that the landlord wont make me dismantle the doorway soundproofing when i move out. high possibility that the back of the closet sound proofing will be permanent.

use case here is that through the doorway is the nursery with the baby. picture is taken from the bedroom that is to be the au pair's room (starting next month). she has another door and we want her room to be a retreat for her from the rest of the house, not for her to have to hear the baby crying when she is off duty. we get 45 hours a week of child care, which is great, but also means she has 123 total hours to herself per week (including sleeping, etc), and we do not want the baby crying to wake her up cause that is not when she will be on duty.

when i was about 8-9 years old, i was forced into sex by some older kids, and to be honest, i did not think anything of it. i actually liked it. 
this went on til i was about 14 years old. all my friends were growing up, getting girlfriends, but i was not. at first i thoughught i might be gay, but as i grew older i started to realize that i was becoming what i feared most as a child, a pedophile. high school was really difficult for me because i was not like others. i had a great group of friends, everyone liked me because i was nice to everybody, but deep down i was a mess. i started spiraling out of control since then.

 i like to consider myself a giving person. the feeling of making someone happy is all i have. i will never have someone to really love and care for, ever! i do not really spend ti ame trying to figure out why i became ""this"" person. genetic accident? or maybe its just a normal part of being human. i look at myself in the mirror and i am disgusted. i still cannot believe this happened to me. i ask myself why everyday, and i just cannot take it anymore. the pain i feel is excruciating and mind altering. i do not want to live as a ""fake"". i am tired of having this burden on my shoulders. i am tired of having these thoughughts.

why even try? there is no magic pill that can fix me, there is no psychiatrist that can help me. why me? i did not choose this, i hate it, i absolutely hate it. i was unwillingly brought into this world that does not accept me. and no matter what anyone has to say about it, you just do not know what its like.

well, what can i say. i do not qualify to be a productive citizen of this planet. they say ""live to love"", and i need to ""love to live"". and if i cannot have that, then i would rather not be here. 

good luck with everything you guys, please do not let this world get even more shittier than it already is, i will be watching from above! :)

652,"we just had our concrete foundation reinforced, so the bottom half of our basement walls protrude about three inches more than the top half. so i am wondering two things:

1. are there any special measures i should take if i finish the walls normally? i guess i should put more batting in the top half, right?

2. is there a not-wildly-difficult way to give the finished walls the same two-level finish as the bare concrete? i am going for kind of a grandma vibe down there and i think it had be cool to have wood panelling on the bottom and wallpaper on top. if that is insane let me know.

654,"posting this to vent since i have no one else to vent to.this is my first post here, but i do visit every so often to read through posts.
 
anyway, let me start off with a little bit of background information. i have been slowly piecing my life back together over the past year after several years of neglect. thoughse years largely consisted of me being consumed by playing online video games to escape aspects of my life (career, finances, friendships, romance) that i had been unhappy with. i managed to break that online video game dependency last year and since then i have been completing the prerequisites for a graduate program i have always thoughught about applying for but never mustered up the courage to (for fear of rejection). being busy with that had helped me from going into one of my intermittent downward spirals. 

however, i recently won a contest for a free vacation for 2.great news, right? i thoughught so too at first. the one person i would have loved to go with basically told me they were unsure if they would be able to go and that i should find someone else. this is a person that i talk to almost every day. (long distance friendship) to be fair, they have potential vacation plans with their family (parents/siblings) later this year which would take up some of their vacation ti ame. the window for me to take the trip is anywhere up until june of next year and is only for 3 nights. is it that difficult to ask for a day or 2 off work within that ti ame frame? i know their job is not that stringent with requested ti ame off either. i thoughught this would be a great opportunity for us to spend ti ame together in person. to me that is an indication that i am not a priority in their life. am i being unreasonable? 

unfortunately, i have no one else to go with. this realization has triggered all the negative thoughughts i had under control and allowed them to reemerge. i have spent most of the day crying to myself consumed with feelings of loneliness. i just want to curl up into a ball and disappear. not like i would be missed anyway. of all things, i never would have thoughught a winning contest prize would have been the trigger to send me back into this state.

tdlr: depressed for several years, but escaped it for a while. won a contest which ended up causing negative feelings to reemerge.

659,"just a long stream of conscience i wanted to put out into the world.i am a 27 years old man who still lives at home with my parents. i have a decent job, more than my fair share of good friends and a close knit loving family but still i often feel depressed and highly negative usually for no real disceright nowible logical reason. i have had a drink so i am now going to ramble ai amlessly about whatever comes to mind, it will be poorly written and you most likely will not read it. 

i had my first girlfriend at the age of 25. she pursued me for a number of months while i rebutted her advances, pri amarily due to anxiety and fear that i would not be in anyway satisfactory to her but also due to her being old 18 and having just gotten out of a long term abusive relationship that i would helped her with. eventually after a month of pretending to have a girlfriend to keep her at bay i realized that i was si amply being foolish so fictionally broke up with my fictional girlfriend and over the following months developed a relationship with her, much to the chagrin of a younger college. as we all worked at a bar at the ti ame the relationship became quite common knowledge and was much talked about, i would worked at the bar on and off for the previous 7 years and knew everyone she had recently gone from drinking at to working behind the bar to spend more ti ame with me and our younger college was the son of the owners partner.   

on the night we had our first real date and went back to the bar we worked at much drink was had and, when we went outside at the end of the night to wait for our taxi our college came out and got overly aggressive with me, for reasons i could not at the ti ame fathoughm, we argued for a while until he declared that he would been sleeping with for the previous month, all the ti ame we had been developing a relationship. i was furious with hi am but rather than fight with hi am i deposited hi am in the bar with his mother and told hi am to keep away from me at work. rather than be angry with her i chalked it up to her getting out of a bad relationship and the fact that i would lied about having a girlfriend at the ti ame so smoothed over it and then worried that my actions had cost me my job. we went our separate ways and met up again the following day, everything was fine and things seemed to be back on track. we both went back to work for a few weeks, got a few funny looks and negative comments but we were ok. then she got fired due to bad ti ame keeping, then he told everyone she would given hi am hiv and i took a few weeks off, eventually going back to work on an understanding with my boss that i would not have to work with his step-son again. the relationship went well for a while, she met my family who were initially unhappy with the age difference and the fact that we shared a bed (very cathoughlic family) but they could see that we were happy so they did not do too much to get in the way. during this ti ame she stopped drinking at the bar i worked at and naturally deleted hi am from her contacts. at this ti ame my granddad was suffering with very bad dementia and my mother and i were the go to carers for hi am while he still lived with my nan, this was a very painful ti ame but my relationship helped me through it. 

eventually thoughugh she started drinking at the bar again and despite the abuse he would doled out to her began to talk to my bosses step son while i was working. she became cold towards me and, when i was leaving for a weekend away with my family broke up with me in a text, naturally i was distraught but put on a brave face and went away with the family. being with family helped but the moright nowing after we returight nowed from our trip we received a phone call from the hospital telling us my grandfather had had a bad turight now and passed away during the night (he would been moved into a home prior to this and taken ill before the trip, this was not uncommon but my mother had stayed home to be with hi am rather than go on holiday). i did not know what to do with myself and turight nowed to her for solace, she spent the night with me and the following day comforting me, then she stopped talking to me again until she declared that seeing me again had been a huge mistake, that she was back with the step son and had been cheating on me for a while. 

i did not know what to do so i just went to work in a haze of unhappiness and watched her fawn over hi am and dance in the bar whilst telling me to just get over it. rather than doing that i thoughught about how best to win her back for the following month, not believing that a woman who would rather be with a 16 year old who told everyone she socialized or worked with at the bar that she would given hi am hiv was not right for me. 
	
over that month i cried, begged and generally made an arse of myself in front of people i would known for years until one day when she came to my house to get the last of her stuff back, flirted with me like she used to then left me cold to text another guy she would also started sleeping with. i realized then, finally, that something had to change so the next day i handed in my notice and took another bar job in a local hotel which had recently opened and had previously offered me a job. she was my first girlfriend, the first girl i was ever inti amate with and the first person to go from treating me with love to utter disdain. i still care about her, even love her and attribute her behaviour to a history of bad relationships and a rough upbringing but i managed to move on. 
	
the hotel i moved to could best be described as a toxic work environment, the management belittled the staff, the staff hated the management and for the most part could not stand each other. i made a few friends, worked ludicrous hours, got stiffed on quite a lot of pay and got screwed over by the managements decision to not actually pay our taxes but deduct the relevant amount from our pay cheques and chalk it up to tax. ended up having to pay the tax man quite a bit for that. during this ti ame however i started to attend a quiz night at a put where i met a bar maid who literally took my breath away, i fell for her the second i saw her and started to drink at the pub as often as i could just to see her. i needed to drink more than a little to gather the confidence to talk to her but when i did we got along excellently and eventually i was able to talk to her stone cold sober withoughut a trace of nerves, so for the first ti ame in my life, i asked her out and she said yes. 

we had two excellent dates and things seemed to be going well, we had talk all the ti ame and i was extremely happy. unfortunately circumstances conspired against us, she had a huge family tragedy and shut off to everyone for a while, we still spoke but the idea of dating was gone. even so i help hope that the future could be bright for us if things changed. 

still feeling like a new me i decided to move on again to a job, applied to work at a british car manufacturing plant and got the job. despite it being nothing like anything i would ever done i was very excited to go and when i did i met several good friends. at this ti ame the girl i would fallen for moved to another country, as it turight nowed out temporarily, and we lost touch. one of my new friends was practically a mirror i amage of me, we were into the same things and got on really well. he had  a swedish girlfriend, they would take it in turight nows to fly out and spend ti ame with each other around their work schedules. one visit she came over with her best friend and we really hit it off and started a relationship over the week she was here, after leaving we kept in touch on skype and i went over to sweden to see her in what was a fantastic holiday but we decided that long distance would not work for a relationship and, remaining friends, we went out separate ways.

life was good, i was more confident than ever and yet i still had periods of depression, anxiety and general anger with people that i could not explain. during this ti ame the second woman mentioned came back from her traveling and we started talking again, everything was going well we met up on the night before my birthday, reconnected and i told her exactly how i had felt since the moment i saw her. we kissed for the first ti ame and i was on cloud 9 i would never been happier, she said she was going to talk to her friends and asked me to wait for her, i agreed to. as i was out with my family they came to tell me they were going to go home as the club we were in was closing i said ok but i had to find the girl and tell her what was happening. i am still fuzzy on the details of what happened at this point but as i was going to talk to her one of my family said something about her to one of her friends. a huge argument ensued and in the aftermath the girl i would just reconnected with and kissed was in hysterics and refused to talk to me about what had happened. i went from top of the world to devastation in no ti ame at all. 

over the night i talked to her in text and she phoned me several ti ames for multiple reasons, to cry, to apologise, to tell me to fuck off and to ask how i could let someone treat her like that after what i would said. in the end i sent her a text telling her to remember what i would said and not to judge me on what another person had said. then i left my phone and went to sleep, when i woke up i had a multitude of missed calls but i went to spend my birthday with my family. she then called again, i apologised and explained that i really did not understand what had happened. we reconciled and decided to draw a line under the night and pick up at a happier point.

after a few days i asked her out again, uncharacteristically opti amistic about my chances i went to work after asking checked in my phone with security and spent the next 6 hours hoping against hope that she would say yes. there were ti ames when i literally muttered ""please say yes"" to myself. when i went to get my phone i saw i had two texts from her and from the very first words i knew i was not getting the response i was looking for. she told me that she would been seeing someone since she got back from her travelling, before we had started talking again at all, and that she had been compelled to kiss me that night but nothing else was going to happen. 

i went through the same routine of begging, pleading and rationalizing that i did the first ti ame but this ti ame i have not had any release to get away from the situation, i cannot just quit my job and use that to move me on again. i do not know any single women and i am still at a point when i do not know if i want to move on, even thoughugh it is clearly the best option to take. i am now stuck in a spiral of being frustrated at work and angry at home. i am avoiding going out with friends unless it is to drink, i am drinking far too much at home and am generally feeling at the lowest point i ever have.

everyone starts to think i am just too lazy to work, and that kills me. all my friends have their awesome careers, buying houses, getting married. i am sitting around in my appartment, thinking about what to do with my life. i am an it-technician, but a really bad one. the place where i got the education basically taught us whatever the company needed us for, but we did not get any basics, like how does active directory work, how do you set up servers, domains etc., but that is what everyone expects from an it-technician. back then i would have been really interested in that stuff, but over the years i just saw it as a way to make money and did not bother, and nowadays i am just not interested in this kind of it anymore at all.

a few years forward i get a cool job as an adserver administrator. i was always interested in web stuff, and even thoughugh i did not even know what an adserver was i just applied for the job, got it, and worked myself in. unfortunately i made a bad decision and quit the job after a couple of years, because going to the job cost almost a quarter of my salary (i live in a rural are, the job was in a city 70km away). if only i knew how hard it would be to find a decent job then...

these days i apply for everything, as a driver for different places, as a shiftworker in big industrial companies, but after being unemployed for so long it seems i have no chance. more and more companies do not even get back to my application. (btw my application, resume etc have all been checked and corrected several ti ames by professionals, as the organization that gives you money while you are unemployed forces you to go to courses in which they teach you what is i amportant about applications, resumes etc)

there is no-one around who could help me financially (my mum died 1,5 years ago, that is when i found out that my family basically was broke, since there was not even enough money for the funeral). 

on top of that, my dad is suffering from depression, and my mum dying did not really make things better as you can i amagine. he is also in financial troubles and has to move out of his house because he cannot afford it anymore. 

over this summer there are 3 different friends getting married, and traditionally you give them a bit of money, the absolute mini amum being 50€, which you usually give if you are not really close to the couple. i will have to go to my drummer's wedding and will not be able to give hi am anything. i feel like shit already. 

i have been unemployed for almost a year now, the first 6 months i still somehow could live, like i could afford to do little things every now and then. then i came to the point where i had not even 40€ a week to buy food for me and my cats, which really sucks, but is doable. at the same ti ame it forces you to pretty much stay at home and do nothing. my friends go out every weekend, go to concerts, etc. i cannot do anything of it anymore, and it sucks so bad because most people think you are just boring and not wanting to do anything.

- i am in graduate school and both my thesis advisors stoped working here and have no one to work with in my next and final year. the thing i was supposed to produce this year is literally awful and i do not think i am good at the thing i am supposed to be good at.

- i found out kind of recently that there is a 50% that i have huntington's, which is so awful that i cannot even think about it and instead of getting tested, i skipped my appointment.

- i gained weight and my hair is too short and i cannot find anything about myself attractive. i am covered in awful tattoos. i was having sex with someone and i think they found me repulsive and i do not really blame them. i have no idea what i am supposed to feel like in my body, and maybe it is gender dysphoria but it is most likely because i am just empty.

- my mom took me out of my father's will and sold my childhood house (in canada, i am in the us) behind our backs with all our stuff in it, so i cannot even go home and see family and i do not know if i could ever again because seeing someone else in that house will hurt me so much.

- i have tons of grading and two enormous projects due this week and i have not started them and now i do not want to. the girl who sent the text is my classes and her boyfriend who showed the texts to her works for my department, and i do not want to see them again. they also have a ton of dirt on me and could get me in trouble, and maybe they might.

- the only thing that is keeping me from literally killing myself right now are my three cats, because nobody will love them as much as i love them and i have had them since they were kittens. but i know my mom would take care of them when i die. i feel like i would get caught if i tried faking my death or running away, and that would just be more embarrassing. i do not have much savings and if i drop out of this program, my family will never talk to me again.

- i do not know why i am posting here. i feel like if i were to tell people i was this suicidal, they would think i was attention seeking unless i actually just did it. i am really embarrassed and i do not feel like i have any options left. i know i will make it look like an accident and probably drive my car into a wall.

- i cannot i amagine any future for myself whatsoever. there is nobody i picture myself with, and there are no jobs i want. i do not know who i want to be. and i am one of the people who thinks our planet is totally dying and that capitalism will just get worse. i feel it on this personal level and this grander level, too.

i had some negative experiences with gps, somehow not wanting to refer me to a psychologist before. when i told them about my depressive symptoms, anxiety/panic attacks and experiences of depersonalisation, they told me to get my heart and brain checked out before doing anything further. one of them volunteered to listen to me instead of referring me to a psychologist. i went to get an ecg, an eeg and other things (the results showed i am fine) but in the process i just got exhausted and stopped going to them. i guess i lost my trust.

i found another gp and on my first consultation, she screened me for depression/anxiety and made an appointment with a psychologist. it was great. i felt hopeful towards it because after so long i can finally see someone and get help. in the meanwhile, i struggled a lot to focus on work and study and felt terrible about myself. to the point i just wanted to end everything. but the booking with the psychologist gave me some kind of hope. that things are going to be better eventually.

so today was the day and i went to see hi am. i went in early and asked the receptionist that i was there for the appointment at 11am. the receptionist asked another receptionist ""should i just let her in?"" the second receptionist then told me no and that she has been trying to contact me (i did have 2 missed calls from unknown number) and that i cannot see the psychologist because he has left for the day. because i did not pick up my phone. ....he probably was still there in his room.

i do not know how i got out of the medical centre. it is stupid... i can just see hi am on another day, right? but i felt like all my hopes were for nothing and i was abandoned and rejected. i made a booking and went on ti ame yet they said i cannot get the service.

i cried my eyes out while i was driving home. i felt like there was absolutely nowhere i turight now to anymore. i have tried so hard but everything is failing me. i feel worthless. i feel lost. i feel so alone.",depression,depression,0.70

tifu by accidentally ruining the walls in my bathroom because of two bees, and now i gotta repaint them.

i was just shitting normally when i suddenly heard two buzzes at the window. i saw two bees half stuck there; i do not know how they got in. i laughed at them, but then one of them got out. i i ammediately zipped up my pants and ran out of the bathroom because i am allergic (not deadly) to bee stings.

i felt extra brave today, so i went to look for something to kill it with, but i found nothing except a random spray. i grabbed the spray in one hand and a sick-smelling spray in the other because i thoughught it would keep them away from me. i turight nowed on the lights and opened the doors, and saw both bees on the floor, but they were kinda far away. i did not want to get close, so i decided to snipe them from a distance.

i missed, so i just sprinted to the door and turight nowed off the lights again. at this point, it had been five minutes, and i really needed to wipe, so i decided to risk it. i went back into the room fully prepared and just sprayed them for like three minutes straight. i kept missing until they made a blunder and got into my previous missed shots, and both died.

to my horror, the walls changed color, and now i have to repaint them, which really sucks because they were in good shape.

tl;dr: i was shitting and then saw two bees with me, so i grabbed a random spray and a sick-smelling hair spray to extinguish them. i kept missing for like three minutes, and now i have to repaint the walls because they changed color.

682,"the funniest joke you you will hear today 
assuming you are healthy, your heart when working normally, acts sort of like a pump, or rather two pumps, you see your right heart expands to draw deoxygenated blood in from the body, and contracts to pump it out to the lungs to become oxygenated. and at the same ti ame, your left heart draws in oxygenated blood from the lungs and then pumps it out to your stupid, misshapen body. now someti ames, irregularities can occur that prevent your heart from pumping properly. ""congestive heart failure"", is an interesting one. say, your heart loses some of its contractile force due to high blood pressure, for example, this will result in the pooling of blood in your left heart, or left ventricle chamber, and in response to this, the cells in your left ventricle will enlarge to push against the higher circulatory resistance caused by the increase in blood pressure, which is a great solution, but only in the short term. much like your parents' decision to try to save their marriage by having, well, you. but because of these enlarged cells, the left ventricle chamber then becomes much smaller, resulting in less blood being able to fill into it and because the blood coming into the left ventricle has nowhere to go, it begins to back up into the lungs and from there, because it is all a cycle, it will back up into the right heart and then, you have got congestive heart failure on your hands. not \*weird swallow\* unlike, how the incessant, heated disagreements between your ti ameworight now mother and father is also, on your hands. the name ""congestive"" heart failure, thoughugh, is apt because fluid then leaks into your alveolar air spaces making it difficult to breathe, and with all this, blood pressure increases, yet again, and the original hypertrophy of muscle cells in your left ventricle is no longer a help, and since the contractile force of your heart has decreased, it certainly cannot pump against the new, much higher resistance  and because of that, your body, in response to the heart not pumping sufficient blood, thinks: ""well gee golly, ha, i must not have enough fluid!"" so it tells your kidneys then, to returight now any liquid you take in, meaning you you will retain a lot more water, which has to go somewhere, so it leaks into your legs, abdomen, and all over the body, and can result in the gaining of 2-3 pounds, per day! which, as you can i amagine, will cause rapid accumulation of total body weight and after just one month, someone afflicted by this disease could amass up to 100 extra pounds! there is effectively no way that a human being could gain weight at this rate, by which any other mechanism. and that is why, it seems as thoughugh it is the only rational explanation as to what must be happening to your mom.",teenagers,noise data,0.90

711,"everything exteright nowal is great. everything interight nowal is far from itso i skipped work today, stayed in bed until 4pm. i do not know why i feel so lousy and worthless. is it depression? is it anxiety or am i just down today? i mean this has not happened before...

as far as life circumstances are conceright nowed everything is great. like really great. i am 24, work my dream job in a high ranking position with good pay and live in a large house with 4 wonderful people including girlfriend and are constantly surrounded by large amounts of caring friends...

so why the heck do i still feel so crummy a heap of the ti ame? i do not get it... maybe the fear of losing all you have is bigger than if you would ever gain it. but usually that just gets me more motivated.

no, the last little while has been a slow downward spiral of selfishness, i am starting to compare myself to others more and more. eugh, i feel like a highshooler dealing with popularity but that is essentially what it is, a few 'cool' people from the office organise a thing together, never invited that kind of crap. why does that bother me so much? i have got other things to do anyway, just nice to feel wanted i guess?

my enthusiasm has gone down the drain, i used to be the guy who through 'just being me' was quite silly and goofy, entertaining or helping people out.
since this job where there are a lot of like minded people many who are quite si amilar however better. in every way. i feel like i will be judged and am competing so i just say and do nothing. i have entered a shell.

for example there used to be ti ames i performed on stage entertaining kids doing all sorts of things. recently after work we all went out to watch one of our coworkers band play at a local bar. everyone gets up and dances except me etc etc.
i really really want to get involved. i promise myself if song x comes on i will do it, i used to perform that one. easy.

it comes on...

alright this is it, anxiety ti ame over, step up, let go and just have a good ti ame.
i lock up. like, completely. i stand there for about 30 seconds frozen and petrified before retreating to spend the remainder of the evening hiding in a bathroom stall...

finally now it is gotten to the point that i cannot even show myself in the office. i am so scared of being with other people that i have not left my bedroom today because i can currently hear my housemate gaming downstairs and i will have to deal with hi am asking if i have been home all day.

my emotions are just a mess. i have no idea how i am going to feel at any given moment, several ti ames a week i snap into a huge rage tantrum for next no reason. a lot of the ti ame directed at my girlfriend, this is usually followed huge guilt remorse for treating her so badly. i am very great up she is still here and is so very patient with me being such a dickhead...

you know when people cannot even correctly spell their goodbyes right that there is something wrong. when people cannot even take the ti ame to fully articulate their feelings into words. i would understand the situation if you were so toright now up that you could not even wrap your mind around the idea of actually letting them go, or that you were crying so hard that you could not eve see what you are typing. i do not think that this is the case for many people in this situation thoughugh. i mean, its wonderful that all of you recognize that your friends are gone, but i feel like the gravity of the situation has not hit some. this is not as if you have lost touch with some people after graduation and you just do not know them as well. in that situation you could easily just contact the person and catch up. in this situation, there is no way that you could ever talk to or see the person again. it is a feeling that is both known and foreign. it is one of the strangest feelings that i have ever experienced. i have suffered with depression, experi amented with drugs, and more. this feeling is much greater than all of thoughse thoughugh. i have never felt this before in my life, i do not even know how to describe it. it as if i am numb, yet i feel everything. it as if i am sad, yet oblivious to situation. it may be shock; it could be that the actual event has not sunk in yet. whatever it is, this is not about me, a horrible thing happened and none of us can do anything to reverse it. all we can do is remember. that is why i think it is ridiculous for some to not even take the ti ame to type out a short, correctly spelled, heart felt message. if you are not going to do that, than stay silent. i am not saying that you are not allowed to feel the pain of the situation; i am saying that it is something that should be treated delicately. i may sound like a total asshole in this, but i feel like the message is i amportant. i could read back over this and realize that i was completely out of line, but in the current state that i am in, it seemed completely justified and true.

methoughdology: a pythoughn script accessed each subreddit and sorted the posts by ""top"" and ""this month"" li amiting to the top 100 posts and top 100 comments from each post. a flesch-kincaid score was then applied to each comment. i then ran filters to remove links, i amages, gifs, removed comments, and other comment types that do not work with the fk model. comments were also filtered out if they were one or two words. fk scores less than 0 were changed to 0 (usually emojis). average fk values were taken for each subreddit for the remaining comments.

the subreddits used contain mostly very popular pages based on subscriber count, ones that i frequently see content from, popular political subs, and others that i was si amply curious about.

i initially used another model to esti amate the political bias for each subreddit, but there were too many confounding variables that made me misinterpret a few subs, so this ti ame i resorted to a si ample eye test and the comments from my last post. my esti amation and yours on a particular subreddit might differ.

this methoughdology will not 100% satisfy your own political biases when you look at this list and see your favorite sub listed so low, or a sub you hate listed so high. the fk model works ok on si ample reddit comments, but we are just redditors after all leaving comments on random posts. we are not peer reviewing articles in every comment section.

the takeaway is that the thinking of ""everyone in the subreddit i hate are a bunch of morons!"" probably does not always apply.",noise,noise data,0.95
724,"i am so alone (long but i need help)i am 17 and i cannot take this anymore.

i used to have a few friends, not really friends, but we smoked weed and played video games. 

i am not a normal guy, i have had some medical problems, dysfunctional family life, few other things, but i was not always an outcast.

in freshman year i made a huge fucking mistake. did acid and shrooms at the same ti ame, while drunk, and to spare the last slice of confidence and self esteem i have left, you can draw your own conclusion to what happened, but i made a big mistake. it was recorded and put on facebook, twitter, instagram, everywhere.

after that, people started to constantly harass and bully me. i became a loser, and the 'friends' i did have all turight nowed on me and left me alone. that was freshman year.

now i am a junior (senior in 6 days).. i ended up transferring schools thinking it would change, but in reality it made things worse. people already knew me at the new school because the video was sent around, and that is all anyone knew me as. 'that guy'...

since transferring 3 years ago, i have not had one friend. i have not had a real conversation since. i convinced the school to let me teach myself, so i sit alone in the in school suspension room for 3 hours a day reading from textbooks and doing shit myself. i spend 3 hours at school alone, and 21 hours alone in my room.

i cannot take much more of this shit. 21 hours a fucking day alone. i say hi to my 'teacher' once a day, i say hi to my dad once a day, and then the rest of the day is fucking nothing. out of the last 5814 hours (hours i am in school a year) i have spent 4536 hours alone in my room. out of the last 3 years, that number grows to 13,608 hours total... alone. for that long. 

i cannot go out because i will get made fun of and i am still recognized, and i cannot do anything but stay in my room.

i am 17, and i cannot do this anymore. summer is coming up... another summer that'll be spent 100% alone. last summer i tried killing myself and failed. tried overdosing on 3000mg of seroquel and woke up 4 days later, dad did not care about me, sister was not home and does not care about my..

i feel like i am going fucking insane. i cannot talk to people anymore because my anxiety goes through the roof, it feels like there is a literal fog inside my head that filters all good thoughughts and focus on nothing but bad thoughughts. think about how hard it is to sleep someti ames. anyone else ever cannot sleep because they think too much? i amagine that, but perpetual.

i cannot talk to psychiatrists because last ti ame i would go in for 5 minutes, he would give me another slip for more pills, then send me on my way. would not discuss problems, if i tried he would up my dosage, and ignored me. last 3 psychiatrists have been like this..

summers coming up in 6 days, i will be genuinely surprised if i am not dead by july.

all my potential was wasted, i have not achieved anything, i am at the bottom and there is no top to cli amb to, even if there was i have given up anyway. life taught me that effort does not pay, i was lied to by society that it does. 

there is such emptiness in me, i even miss my narcissistic ex, if not everything else at least he was equally broken. i am looking at another man sleeping right now and i feel nothing even when i want to and hoped to feel something.

what is the point of a birthday if you do not feel like you are living anyway? might as well give me condolences. someti ames i wish my parents were not there so i can off myself withoughut worrying, hell even dogs get put down when they are suffering but somehow i am selfish for wanting to end a life that was worth nothing and has zero hope of getting better, i am already 28 and a failure.

i have a shitty job based on manipulation, while i used to be valued for my brain and skillsets. now i feel like i am worth nothing. i will forever regret trusting the wrong people. i suffer humiliation with a smile, i pretend to be someone i am not so i would not be a burden for my family, especially since my dad was fired. tbh i would work for half the pay for double the hours if it was a place i could learight now and progress and not a dead end job but this is where i am. just when i think i have hit the bottom another layer of hell opens up 

i have nothing, i am no one, i cannot relate to anyone around me and the only thing people appreciate about me is the way i look and let us be realistic  even that is about to expire, though i lived most of my life as an ugly duckling the novelty of looking okayish quickly wore off.

honestly. 

i would be ecstatic if sadness and random bouts of breakdowns were caused be a chemical i ambalance. that would be understandable. i could deal with it, i would be logical. i could stare hopelessness in the face and be like ""fuck you, you are just in my chemically i ambalanced mind"".

what i am scared of is something different. i am scared that people normally go through this and that i am just weak. too weak and unable to pass things which every other human flourishes at. i cannot handle that nothing is ""wrong"" with me, and that i am just terrible at being alive.

my best friend is bipoplar. when she goes through depressive ti ames, she literally just wants to be reminded that her brain is fucking with her and that everything will be okay. i spend half my ti ame battling my depression and trying to just logically overcome it. that would be great. i could be like, well damn, i am having a depressive episode and i know this is not really my fault, it is just my brain being stupid, so i can just wait it out.

but i do not have that clarity. it is the same reason people hate labels but also want to know that they are not alone in experiencing whatever it is that they think is only bothering them. people like to know they are not alone. i want to know that i can take some medicine and feel better. i just want to **know**.

sorry if my post seems insensitive. i have been trying to see a therapist for like.. 3 years. got close once and spoke to a school counselor and i am pretty sure i seemed too happy to get anything useful figured out. it is waaaay too hard to get a therapist. make it is being depressed that makes it hard, but i will not know until i actually get a damn appointment

interestingly, the gap shrinks among older men and women — a 65-year old man in 2023 was expected to live another 18.2 years, and a woman could expect another 20.7 years. why this smaller gap? more men die before age 65, dragging men's life expectancy at birth down. thirty-one percent of men who died in 2023 were below 65, compared to 19% of women.

so i am 19, have no real life friends, have not been properly outside in like 3 years. basically the biggest loser possible, i have aspergers syndrome like that is a reason for how i am... i left ""highschool"" in the first year with 3 months left, this was a big deal since it is illegal.

anyway i tried going back to a different school 2 years later, went the first day on no sleep and a lot of valium, did not go back. after all these years talking to doctors and such my mother understood.

i hope that is enough back story, i am not a good writer obviously.
anyway multiple suicide attempts, constant ups and down of depression, feelings of regret and disappointment. i generally do not know what to do anymore, i am just so afraid of people. if anyone i do not know really well is downstairs ill wait until they are gone to go down or do something. 

sorry if i am just rambling. 

i was in a ""mental hospital"" for 5 weeks when i had a serious suicide attempt when i was 16, at first i hated it. but after awhile it was comforting having people telling you what to do, also having people to talk to all the ti ame was nice. 

i am so ashamed of myself at this point that i just wish i could press a button to end my life.

784,"looking to semi permanently close this doorway to add a soundproofing barrier to the doorway and the back of the closet. the rest of the wall that is not pictured has a much thicker wall made of plaster (1909 house) so should not be as much of a problem. 

i am in a rental but am also a professional painter. landlord keeps rent low so i have painted all three bedrooms for hi am both for free, as well as because this is where i am raising my baby and want the paint to stay on the wall (it was chipping off).
     that to say, i have pretty free rein to do stuff, and i will also likely need to dismantle it and do some repairs when i move out some years from now. when i moved in, landlord had great stuff foam sealing the doorway closed. 

so, cut to fit soundboard? what is the best way to attach that? any other options? whatever it takes to dismantle this, i will not have a problem doing the repairs necessary to put things back together. au pair will be here one year with both parties having the option to extend it to two years. we will almost certainly have an au pair living there a mini amum of two years even if we do not extend this particular person. strong possibility of several years of an au pair living in this room. small possibility that the landlord wont make me dismantle the doorway soundproofing when i move out. high possibility that the back of the closet sound proofing will be permanent.

use case here is that through the doorway is the nursery with the baby. picture is taken from the bedroom that is to be the au pair's room (starting next month). she has another door and we want her room to be a retreat for her from the rest of the house, not for her to have to hear the baby crying when she is off duty. we get 45 hours a week of child care, which is great, but also means she has 123 total hours to herself per week (including sleeping, etc), and we do not want the baby crying to wake her up cause that is not when she will be on duty.

my mom just died, and i have no one to tell it to. that is a lie, but i no longer know if the person, the only person who i thoughught i can talk to, wants or even can talk to me. i feel like i am slowly sucking her soul out with my problems, and now this? its been plainly obvious that shes tired of listening to my shit, day after day, and i do not blame her. shes been there for me for months, someti ames people need a break. but ive also got the feeling that she does not trust me at all. no one trusts me. i just want to reach out to someone, share things with them, and have them share things with me. ive been talking to her for months, and i know almost nothing about her. literally nothing. and its not her fault. i am not blaming her, i am blaming me, for falling in love with someone i do not even know. how did it happen, when i do not even know her? how can you fall in love with someone you know nothing about? and i cannot tell her these things, i do not want to put this on her, i mean how do you tell someone that you cannot stop thinking about them, that you dream about them at night, that you cannot get them out of your mind? that was my biggest mistake, telling her that i dreamed she disappeared, and i could not find her. that is when she started to avoid me. or maybe the avoiding is in my head. i do not think it is thoughugh. 

my ex wife will not let me talk to my son, and hes all the way across the country. i miss my mom, i miss my brothers, i miss my son, i miss the only person who listens to my problems. i knew that eventually she would tire of my shit, because eventually every one does. everyone leaves me, it is only a matter of ti ame. i cannot stop crying.



i am supposed to start school soon. ha! i am an idiot masquerading as an intelligent person. ""cognitive neuroscience"". beyond the si ample fact that i am a fucking si ampleton, i have ptsd, and i panic even just crossing the road. i went to this parade on the first. there were so many people, i could not even breath. it was my first ti ame out of the house. but i am pretending like i was not phased. i stood there dying inside my own head, hands shaking, trying to enjoy the music, enjoy the floats, but i felt like i was about to be killed. all the loud drums sounded like incoming missiles exploding. people kept whistling and it sounded like ordnance dropping out of the sky. this beautiful woman was standing next to me, i wanted to say hi, but i could not even talk. when was the last ti ame i talked to someone face to face? months ago. and a beautiful woman? years. i make it sound like i am so old, i am really not. i am only 23. i tried walking home, but i am so fat i nearly had a heart attack. it was 4 miles, all up hill, and i did not take any breaks, so when i got to the top, i felt so good, but it only lasted a little. after, i had so much emotion in me. i cannot stop crying, ive been crying since new years eve. 

oh yeah, my support network. ha! it is reddit! people on reddit! people who obviously have zero trust for me. who knows why. it is sort of this in group kind of thing, its very cliquish, and i have not ""made the cut"" as it were, even thoughugh ive been one of them for like a year. i mean, where else does an agoraphobic ptsd depressed fuckwit go for his support? there is not many options. ive tried everything i could to get them to trust me. nothing has worked. i mean, they talk to me, they pretend to accept me, but i know the truth. the whole truth is they think i am a spy. ha! who knew reddit could be so serious? it makes me feel even more pathetic than i already do.

ive been sober for months. i thoughught it might help, because before, when i was homeless and withoughut money, drinking felt good, it drowned my sorrows, but it also took away my inhibitions. i have not told anyone this, because i do not anyone who trusts me, but i tried killing myself a few ti ames in 2012. i never really went through with it, just got myself close to the edge. deep down i do not really want to die, i never have, i just want the pain to go away. i love life. life is so beautiful, but so painful. the first ti ame was in feb last year. i tried cutting myself on my leg, near the artery. i bleed till i felt weak, but then i chickened out and put a touright nowiquet on. i was drunk then too. i told the people at work that i was just sick, and i ran my leg into some metal. i was pretty clever, i even cut a hole in my uniform. ha, its good i got out of the army to be honest. they treated me like shit too. i was just as depressed then, and they all knew it. they just did not care. shit, i think some wanted me to kill myself, even encouraged it. never told anyone that either. it is a good thing i am not as weak willed as i think i am, or i would probably be dead.  second ti ame was with my belt. i suffocated myself a few ti ames, never like in a sexual way, just to get myself as close to dead as possible. scary shit. i got close once, blacked out just as i loosened it. actually, they always wanted me dead. i was in a line troop, about 3 years ago, before my ex wife took my son away, before she left me when i deployed, and the 1sgt there told me he was going to kill me, or that i should kill myself. good ti ames. anyways, so alcohol drowns everything out, but makes me attempt suicide. so yep no alcohol .


my ex posted on christmas that i am just a sperm donor. i did not have money to send to her or my son, so she calls me nothing but a sperm donor. so i responded in full view of the world ""you are right, i have been a terrible father. i let my pride at not being able to buy hi am a present get in my way of skyping with hi am. that was selfish of me. moving across the country was selfish of me. i know it does not mean much, i am sorry. i know it just sounds like excuses, i did need a change, and i needed it bad. you are a better mother to hi am than i have ever been a father."" she did not believe it, neither does any of her friends. you know the worst part of all this? she tricked me into the army. i did not want to join, i seriously did not. and two years in she leaves me for some piece of shit miles away. then i deploy. i was actually going to kill myself in iraq, like, get shot on patrol, die a hero, or get blown up in my room. too bad the stupid iraqis were too stupid to actually hit anything with their rockets. that would have been a nice way to go. i got back from iraq, that was one of the worse days of my life. you have no idea what it is like to come back from hell, to a huge party filled with couples reuniting, dads with sons, mothers with daughters, wives to husbands. i was crying, no one noticed, they were all too wrapped up in each other. i was literally balling tears. 


anyways, i live in a wonderful place now. the rent is paid, i am not homeless, i have food, but now i cannot sleep. cannot sleep at all. i goes day, 3-4 days with an hour a night. i slept two last night, only because ive only slept about 5 this week, and well yeah. i am pretty sure everything ive posted about the one person who has been there for me is just paranoia and delusion brought on by my lack of sleep. i do love her. its strange loving someone you have never met. but now my mom died. i did not even get to say good bye. i had not called her in years. part of me wanted to, but i felt so bad, because i feel like i abandoned her and my dad. they were both homeless, and i had money from the army. i could have sent them some, but i did not. what a piece of shit son i am. and now i cannot tell her i am sorry. i cannot tell her i love her and i miss her. death is so final. this is part of the reason i have not killed myself, because maybe there is one person out there wishing to talk to me, that misses me, and just has not called me or picked up the phone. maybe people do love me and they are too afraid to show it. or maybe i am too blind to see it.

when we are together, we seem to have short patches of not particularly happy detente interspersed with huge periods (going on for multiple weeks) of her being very critical of me. most of the ti ame i am fine, but during our chats she is very persuasive and i start to think of myself as a monster and want to do harm to myself. i am, luckily, quite inept at doing harm to myself. the worst that i have done is smashed my head multiple ti ames against a door or my laptop computer or a glass. one ti ame we were outside when this was happening and i ran to go do something more i ammediate but there was no traffic at the ti ame.

twice i have left the house and gone back to live with my parents. the first ti ame was because she was so mad at something i said that she asked me to leave (and told my parents on the phone that i could never come back). the second ti ame was because our joint marital therapist said it was in my best interests for survival for us to take some ti ame apart. she saw this as my therapist and me as ganging together, and since that she is been unwilling to go back to therapy.

now i finished out the year in a charter school. summer i felt the same as last summer, lonely and sad. it is july and i stated dating a girl. she was so beautiful inside and out literally. she only wanted the best for me. and if i were in an argument she would stick behind me right or wrong, and to me that is love dude. none of this i ammature bull shit. this was real. in august shit went down her dad got mad at me and chased me out the house and he mom threaten to call the cops. her dad does not get to see her much and i ruined his day with her... well his day and he ruined my night. her mom made her lose all contacts with me. except we text. and have been for a while. but barely we never get to talk much. by october i figured it was my best friend and his friend who had done the deed. i instantly blocked them on all social media. let us fast forward through this year. which consists of horrible people. i was in a school for expelled kids 25 miles away from home. anyways that was hell but i lost all my friends. i had to make new ones thru social media. they are all snakes i dropped them all. i went thru panic attacks and suicidal thoughughts thru the whole year. now that it is over i want it to start again. and that is because going to school is the only social interaction i have. and with out a social life i am going to kill myself. i told the girl i dated and she got really scared. she said “do not do anything stupid, i love you. stay home.” and i did. it was january at this ti ame. sorry let us got back to present. i hate the way i was and who i am. i just wish i could have done everything in 2018 different. that year... haunts me... i hate it. i want to cry but i cannot. i will break and i will kill my self.

813,"feeling suicidal as 30m that is a shy loner outcast virgini am in my 30s and alot of people my age are married with children, busy with work, already have their clique of friends, so it is very hard to make new friends at my age.

i went through a lot of verbal and emotional bullying in school and it continued in college and office jobs in adulthoughod. it seems like most other geeks/nerds at least had other geeks/nerds as friends when growing up. but i did not even have them as friends. people have said in condescending ways that i do not talk, i look lonely, i just ""study all the ti ame"", i have never had a girlfriend, i am short, etc. i have had to deal with so much bitteright nowess and ptsd flashbacks for pretty much my whole life since middle school. 

not just about the past bullying but how it has affected my life right now. that is, i now have social anxiety, and people have absolutely *no* empathy for shy people and victi am-blame them for being weak. i cannot just ""get over it"" because even when i consistently try to make friends, be confident and outgoing by attending meetups, many of the people there are cliquish and unwelcoming towards shy, low-status males. so many ti ames people ignore what i say, talk over me and interrupt me, treat me like a 3rd wheel, talk to others instead of me, if left alone with me then make up an excuse to leave me, etc. for the ones who are friendly and actually listen, alot of them do not show up to following meetups

what is so frustrating is that i feel i am way more proactive than most people yet i have nothing to show for it. not just in regards to how i always have to go to meetups and go alone whereas most people already have friends and do not need to go to meetups. but also in how i have to strike up conversations with people whereas people who already have friends and cliques can get away with making no effort in socializing with new people with lesser status than them. 

for example, one common advice is ""ask people questions"" and ""people love talking about themselves"". i have asked many people many questions about themselves and shown interest in them, only for them to either show disinterest and give blunt replies, or talk at length about themselves, while not asking me *any* questions and showing *no* interest in me

another example of my proactiveness is that i have spent nearly a year on weightlifting and bjj, yet i do not really feel any more confident, less shy, and or have less ptsd flashbacks than before. i also tried meditation many ti ames and hardly noticed any i amprovement. i have also attended plenty of toastmasters meetings and given numerous speeches yet noticed no i amprovement in my life

i have traveled to nearly 10 countries and spent a few months living in some of them. most were friendly and some were rude towards me, possibly judging me as a ""loser back home"" who came there to escape my problems back home. 

another common piece of advice from society for introverts is to play sports as you can have fun withoughut talking as much. but i often am not taken seriously, get picked dead-last, many ti ames have to deal with rude i ammature pricks trying to shove me and such, rude teammates being cliquish and showing obvious favoritism towards their friends or guys taller than me, etc. i am in ok shape as i am around 5'6 and 145 lbs

another common piece of advice from society regarding getting dates is ""it is a numbers game"", ""you got nothing to lose by asking her out"". i have *literally* cold-approached over 2000 women at nightclubs/shopping malls/coffee shops/etc and did not get *even one* girlfriend/lay from it. i got around 10 girls willing to go on dates with me (none of them wanted a 2nd date), and maybe one would have been interested in a hookup at a nightclub, but another guy took her from me and i did not see her again. 

what angers me is that so many guys can easily get girlfriends despite having never cold-approached a woman as they always get introduced to them because they have status/social circle, or they use dating apps with photos demonstrating their status/social circle. i had no choice but to cold-approach because i have been a reject/outcast/loner my whole life

i have also seen numerous therapists and none of them really helped. sure, they listened and showed some empathy but did not really offer any solutions. 

since i am socially screwed, i can at least do well with my career and financially, right? not so much. i have a high net worth and income for my age, but it is chump change compared to other software engineers my age. as angry as i am about being very underpaid, i am finding it nearly i ampossible to get a new higher-paying job because of all the competition, i often feel so unmotivated and depressed that i lack the energy to study for coding interviews, etc. some of them make 3-5x what i make as they had friends refer them for jobs, they did not have employment gaps like i did from workplace bullying, they can concentrate when preparing for interviews as they do not have depression/ptsd like me, etc. 

why are people so cruel/judgemental/condescending towards low-status males who cannot join cliques? is it because they have no empathy for they have to go through because they themselves never had to experience being excluded, ignored, bullied, etc? or is because of ""hurt people hurt people""? they are hurt themselves so instead of helping social rejects, they want to project their hurt onto them? if so then why have i been shitted on so much even thoughugh i did nothing wrong?!

i was creating some content for my side project — a cute little photoshoot in lingerie. i felt confident and wanted to send a preview to someone i have been talking to. he is always very enthusiastic when i send hi am stuff, so i figured why not brighten his day?

well, in my rush, i tapped the wrong “tom” in my contacts. instead of sending the photo to “tom - fun,” i sent it to “tom - work.” yes. my boss.

along with the photo, i also sent a cute caption that said:
“hope you are ready for more tonight, baby.”

three seconds later, i realized what i had done. my soul left my body. i tried to delete the message but he had already seen it.
then he replied:

“i assume this was not meant for me.”

here's a brief summary of my life so far:

- abused sexually and emotionally by parents for 20 years
- escaped them last november
- been financially struggling, about 80% of my income goes to rent.
- i cannot work consistently because of ptsd and ibd
- came out as transgender last year and am currently 4 months on testosterone. this would be a good thing but my top and bottom dysphoria have exploded to levels where i cannot leave the house. currently cannot afford top surgery.
- i have never had a problem with school but i am in school for engineering and classes are hard to begin with but ptsd makes sitting through lectures extremely overwhelming and exhausting
- there are so many little things to do to make sure my parents are completely out of my life and also to make sure college is paid for that i am completely buright nowt out from being in constant crisis for half a year

i have been feeling like every interaction with people hurts me so i have withdrawn. i do all of the things that are supposed to make you feel better, i exercise 5 days a week, i eat a vegan diet, i do yoga almost every moright nowing.

these things used to work but they are not working anymore and the pain from my ptsd and complex ptsd are too much to take. i can barely afford to eat. i am a waste of space and the only thing that makes me feel better consistently, which is singing, i cannot do all the ti ame because it will annoy my roommates and also my voice is fucked from second puberty. i feel like everyone prefers to talk and no one wants to listen to what i have to say, i just get talked over or i freeze and dissociate when it is my turight now to speak. a huge cptsd trigger for me is people telling me what to do/interfering in my business when not asked. i feel so ignored and cast aside. people do not believe me when i am right about things. lately when i have tried to stand up for myself i just get shot down or ignored.

lately i have been realizing that i do not feel safe anywhere. not my body (dysphoria), not my sleep (nightmares), not in food (ibd), not my house, not my school, not my friends, not anywhere. i have started the healing process from my childhood shit but it is worse than the actual trauma. i cannot keep on doing this alone. 

maybe i just need to fucking die. it will be good for the world because i will not be a burden anymore and it will be good for me to finally feel safe (not feeling at all). i self harmed today and was on the edge of compulsively stabbing myself. maybe i should just do it. god i just want something in my life to go my way. at least i can choose to leave it.

honestly, i have no friends. i have pushed my only two friends away to focus on my boyfriend because he makes me the happiest and that is what i thoughught i needed but he does not do the same. so now, i am just utterly alone. no interight nowet friends, no online friends. it just fucking sucks. i found this guy in school that i would like to be friends with but i am way too shy to talk to hi am. and honestly i feel like i find a person then it seems like i obsess over them or something because i just want people in my life, i want someone there for me. but i just have no one. and a lot has changed for me in my life over the past year that just makes it even worse. anyways, enough about this bullshit and i will stop this rant here because really i could go on about a lot but it is just pointless.

i am currently in the midst of the worst depressive episode i have had in at least a year. i have been on a mood stabilizer for a few months, and it at least helped me function a bit better. i am currently tapering off of it because i have to switch doctors and the waiting list is 8 weeks long for the new one. my life is falling apart, but that is really nothing new. 

i have been seeing things out of the coright nower of my eye a lot more than usual lately, but i did not think anything of it until tonight. while driving, i looked in my rear view mirror and clearly saw a very dead-looking woman in the back seat, staring out the window. i turight nowed around and she was, of course, gone. a few minutes later i saw a shadowy man on the sidewalk waving orange flags who also disappeared. shortly after, a man who i am pretty sure was real looked up at me with glowing red eyes, then back down at his phone. when i got home a few minutes later, my gym bag suddenly weighed about 50 pounds more than it did when i left the gym - i had a mental i amage of a hand pulling it down that i was sure was happening, but i did not look because i was afraid to see it. 

the thing is, i know these things are not real. logically i know there was not a disappearing dead woman in my backseat. does that mean it is not actually psychosis? does the fact that i am only seeing these things for a moment mean it is just my i amagination? they definitely feel real. 

i am really afraid to say anything to anyone; the first ti ame i am pretty sure no one believed me, they all just went along with it to make me feel better. i was kind of an overdramatic teenager. what if people think i am just doing it for attention? if i tell my new shrink, will i automatically be locked up? i am not actively suicidal right now. 

i do not know what to do. i am just getting used to the bipolar diagnosis and i really do not want to add psychotic depression onto that. i am terrified that these things are going to keep popping up and get worse, and i am afraid anyone who finds out is going to think i am either completely unstable, or making it up for attention.

i have been severely depressed since i was in the 6th grade. i have been on more than a dozen different kinds of medication for my depression and my psychosis as well. the meds i always took for my depression seemed to help at ti ames, but when i am faced with the reality of being low-class, jobless, and having nobody to support me other than a crisis phone line, i cannot help but wonder if what is happening on the outside is actually causing my depression of if it really is an illness that i have.

because of this, regardless of how much medication i take or what kind of medication i am on, it never seems to help. thus, my doctor thinks that the only option left would be ect.

i have tried talking to my mother about the possibility of ect but her only response is she thinks i have never had depression in the first place, therefore i do not need it. the same really goes for the very few friends i actually have. some of them even thoughught i was making it up and being ""melodramatic"" to try and get attention.

835,"i am creating a historical game set in xviith century france in a monument called port-royal-des-champs. it is part of a research project on heritage promotion (i am at the chcsc lab of the university of versailles).

the abbess garden story is a mix of history and fiction. it begins in 1643 and occurs in the abbey of port-royal-des-champs in france. this abbey is now a [national museum](https://www.port-royal-des-champs.eu/). the main plot revolves around the legacy of a deceased and very real british spy, [john cecil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_cecil_(priest)), who died in paris in 1626.  
  
nathalie genet-rouffiac is the director and curator of the port-royal-des-champs, but she is also a historian specialising in spies. before joining the museum, she did her phd on the british islands in the 17th century and worked on english and irish nationals in france who were often forced to become spies. she then worked as the head of archives for the wwii spies in france.   
  
i asked her for an interview on real spies of the 17th century. for about 1 hour, we discussed british spies and their relation to this place, gardening history, religious views of the ti ame, etc. you can watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4phsut4x6xq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4phsut4x6xq)

that is kind of where my problem comes in. about a year and a half ago i loved playing sports and it was my favorite hobby at the ti ame. but now, i would rather stare at the wall than doing that. and it becomes hard to think that way when i play two sports in the best possible local teams at the same ti ame, train five days a week, have two- three games every weekend and being the only goalkeeper means that i have to play every single game and be on every single training every week. all my friends enjoy playing their sports a lot, but since i have a hard ti ame enjoying it now we barely meet since that was basically our only thing we both enjoyed doing, which makes me sad because it feels like i do not have anyone to really hang out with. my parents (well, mostly my dad) are really into sports and their hearts would be broken if i would decide to quit (not to mention, they would probably be pretty disappointed). all of this as led to me feeling sad, depressed, anxious and unmotivated to do physical activities. i have tried to talk to my dad about it, but thoughugh i have to be thankful that he atleast tried, it does not feel like he really cares about what i have to say. he still tries to be like: hey, why do not you go out and play football with your friends? wanna go out and play with me? oh boy, you are super hyped about that football game next week, right? and i kindly say: of course, or, yeah, since it does not feel like i can say no anymore. it may sound like my dad is a jerk, but he is actually really kind and he does not want to be sad, but it does not seem like he really understands how much this affects me. i do not know why i have started to feel this way about stuff (not only sports, but my other interests like gaming shifts with me aswell). i do not know what to do anymore since if i quit i will most likely be alone withoughut friends, but if i continue playing then i probably will continue being sad and depressed. is it because i have hit puberety or is it because of some other reasons. if you can give me some sort of advice or any kind of help, then please do so. thanks.",depression,depression,0.80

856,"i am lonely and unsure how to fix it.
this kind of turight nowed into a rant... 

i am lonely. since early high school i have found it near i ampossible to make friends. i escaped from this problem by not thinking ever; playing video-games all night and sleeping through school (literally, my parents even got me a cool pillow that fit in my pocket). after an existential crisis i deleted all the games from my computer and set out to conquer my shyness. it worked. i am no longer shy. however, shyness was not the problem. i si amply have no idea how to interact with people. i took the same approach towards solving this problem as i did every other problem i have ever had. i looked it up on the interight nowet. unfortunately, i was unable to find much useful data online as almost all information was about how to make girls magically attracted to me withoughut exercise in only 3 easy steps 100% of the ti ame. i could not find any databases of conversations showing how to pick up friends, which would be much more useful to me than casual sex. 

i am a junior in college now. i just got out of a two year co-dependent relationship. i have no idea how to establish emotional inti amacy outside of a romantic relationship. i can maintain small talk for a decent period of ti ame and do not come across as awkward as i i amagine this post sounds, as i do not usually communicate directly from my thoughughts. 

i have acquaintances with whom i get drunk and hang out occasionally, one really caring close friend who saw me crying and has been looking after me, and one close friend who used to be in love with my and i fear still is, making it irresponsible of me to seek his support. i spend most of my days trying to distract myself with logic puzzles, music, alcohol, or drugs. i hang out with people i know do not like me (they do not dislike me, they are nice people, they are just indifferent) because sitting in my room alone is depressing. 

i am failing out of school because i have no motivation. i do not see why having a piece of paper that allows me to get a job i do not want will make me happy. counseling has been utterly useless. when i tell her my problems she tells me i am depressed and that i should take drugs that barely outperform placebo and arguably do not due to a bias in which studies are reported and the use of inert placebos. by this friday i must decide whether i have the energy to pass my finals, as friday is the last day i can take medical leave. 

i do not have much hope for the future. i have no idea how to make friends and am very lonely. i am beginning to believe that perhaps it is not a lack of skills but an unchangeable part of my personality that keeps me isolated. 

how does one make friends? i have asked this question to people before an always get answers involving things i do not understand how to do. just go talk to people. how? join a club. i did, i did the club activities, the people there were not so incredibly i ampressed with my ability to listen to them talk that they invited me into their social circle. 

i am interested in math, technology, cli ambing things, mixed martial arts, building things, and can find just about anything interesting. it is not hard for an activity to compete with sitting in my room crying :p. 

i have always been exceptionally good at math. my perfect math scores and math team performance were most certainly the reason i was able to get into a good university despite putting almost no effort into my classes in high school, and my ability to get as in my math classes here withoughut doing any homework and studying for a few hours before tests is the only reason i have not yet failed out. i feel like i might be happy with my life if i could somehow use this gift to benefit people who are suffering. when i try to think of a situation that would make me happy, being in a position where i help many people and i am irreplaceable seems to be the only one where i can justify my existence.

i feel emotionally i ammature for my age. i am not ready to graduate and take on life. i want to curl up in a ball and cry. i am lonely. i wish i had friends. 

i am not exactly sure why i am posting this, but it feels good to do so. if anyone has been in a si amilar position and learight nowed how to interact with other people i would appreciate some advice. if you feel like you need to know more about me to offer advice, please ask. if you would be willing to help me via chat i would appreciate that too.

857,"kind of flirting with the idea.i do not know what is and is not technically suicidal. i never asked because i was afraid of what might happen if i talked openly to it to mental health practitioners. i explicitly wanted to not be alive for about 15 years. daily. every hour of every day that i was awake, at least once, i would be reminded, ""hey! you really want to not be alive right now!""

i would fantasize about cars taking me out. i lived on a busy street. people went fast. i almost got hit dozens of ti ames living there. i would quadruple check both sides, thoughugh, every ti ame i crossed the street. often ti ames while actively fantasizing about not seeing someone, or not being seen. both, i guess.

but i never thoughught about *doing it.* i just always fixated on resentment toward the fact that i was alive, wishing i would never been boright now, idealizing the thoughught of just fading away like a shadow when the light moves just right so it slowly becomes nothing at all and nobody even notices. i never wanted anybody to be hurt. i just wanted to not be hurting anymore myself. because that is all i have ever known. for my entire life. my *entire life.* and i was so tired, so tired, so tired.

i had two good years and i did not want to die at all. i did not think about it much, the idea of it. i would only ever thoughught about how sad it was, the way i used to felt. it became this past tense thing. the way i used to felt but felt no longer and would never have to feel again. so many of my issues were gone. all my life nobody's ever loved me and nobody's ever understood me and nobody's ever cared to even try to and i found someone who did, she did, she did all of thoughse things, and i was so happy and i was hopeful for the future.

and things did not work out. and that was tough, but i was fine. i still had my regrets, and i still do, but i did not feel any of thoughse old, familiar feelings the way that i used to. and so i was still thankful for that experience, that forever that we spent together that turight nowed out to only last two and a half years when i was so certain it would be so much longer.

and i got back home. and things were *hard.* getting home was hard. getting home was stressful. 40 hours and 2800 miles in a uhaul with a wiggly dog on my lap. and then getting home was just the start of it.

going to arizona ruined my disability clai am. two year+ process killed because some incompetent doctors who never took my medical history kept writing ""he should be working but does not want to."" they did not get my medical records from my prior clinic. they kept saying they were working on it, but could not tell me what was wrong. i signed 3 different releases. i tried calling them a number of ti ames over the months. i was there for a year and a half, and i was seeing them in particular for over a year. they still had not gotten my medical records when i would left. they would ""been trying"" but just would not communicate with me about it at all except at our sext-weekly appointments they would remark on how odd it was that they would had not gotten them yet and how they would have to ask what was going on with that.

a couple of weeks before my actual hearing my lawyer asked me for my old clinic's information. later that day they left a message stating once and for all what the problem was: my old clinic would only accept *their own* hippa form. all my lawyer did was have them fax a copy over. all my old clinic had to do was have them fax a copy over. they were too incompetent to figure that out, but because they are doctors, and they wrote in my medical records, ""i think he should be working but he does not want to be working,"" that is all that matters. the clear and consistent patteright nows in my longstanding and persistent medical history just hand waved away by a couple of people who just, quite frankly, do not give a shit about people. they just want to get their little checks from medicaid.

so my lawyer told me that the likelihood of an appeal going my way was pretty poor, but if i was going back to see my old, supportive practitioners (who initially encouraged me to file in the first place), that after a couple of months of treatment, i could start the process again and would likely receive a more favorable outcome. i just do not know if i have two years left in me.

but at least i would have the option. at least i would be able to get *effective* treatment again in the mean ti ame. i was looking forward to that.

it was difficult for me to get back on medicaid back home. i had to fill out weird forms and i had to get weird confirmation letters sent from arizona back to new hampshire and even just gathering the wherewithal necessary to deal with all of it was so much. it took me almost two weeks to be able to get myself to finally finish it. i would try every couple of days, thinking i would gotten whatever problem i would had all figured out, only to have another one pop up and overwhelm me and i would just lay down for a while and do my best to not want to cry. but i got approved, and i was excited to actually get some help.

but i did not schedule an appointment. i do not know when i will be able to get there - like, physically, if that is even necessary, althoughugh i am sure it will be because they will want to know about my physical health, probably, and want to run some blood work, probably. and my old clinic, where i know and trust the practitioners, where i know it is staffed by people who actually care about their patients and are not just trying to scam easy money from medicaid while providing the least possible ""services"" and undermining peoples' futures. god, going to that place in arizona was *the worst.* i *dreaded* every appointment. it was just 45 minutes of some lady criticizing my entire life withoughut ever trying to understand why i was the way that i was or why i felt why i felt, just expressing frustration that i was not more like everybody else.

but i am not, thoughugh. and it is really fucking difficult. is not that the whole point of trying to get help? because it is so fucking hard?

anyway, i have not even called to make an appointment yet. i do not know when i would be able to get there. i was living with my mom and everybody in that house, which was a lot of people, and it was an hour away from my clinic. but i was not about to try some new one.

anyway, my mom's husband is a belligerent alcoholic and he would get loaded every night and try to pick fights with me. the first night i got back he got physical with me. grabbed my coat neck and shoved me against a wall threatening me. i forget what he even said. it was 10 minutes after i walked through the door. i had not even started unloading my entire shambles of a life out of the back of the fucking uhaul i spent the better part of a week in riding across the literal country. like, the whole fucking thing of it.

and it is been like that every night. he just follows me around trying to pick fights with me. most of the ti ame i could ignore hi am. laugh at hi am, even. it was pathetic. he was pathetic. he *is* pathetic. just a sad, stupid man, angry at the world and trying to take it out on me.

but he went after my dog a couple of ti ames and i would scream at hi am because my dog is my whole world. he is my ***whole world.*** he kept me stable through all of this shit. he kept me sane through all of this shit. i would be so lost withoughut hi am. and nobody's going to fucking grab my dog. he is a good dog and he does not misbehave. this piece of shit grabs my dog's leash and yanks on his neck because *his* dog is going crazy. i about lost my mind.

that was the third ti ame he put his hands on me and i told my brother, who was living there, during a very long discussion that i do not know how many more ti ames i can tolerate that man putting his hands on me. and i wrote an email to my father briefly outlining the situation. but nothing really happened.

and so he keeps following me around and starting shit and a couple of nights ago he put his hands on me again and i did not manage to keep mine to myself. i did not go crazy, or anything. i did not hit hi am. he tried to hit me. he scratched me like an actual child. i guess that should not be surprising. putting your hands on another person is for children, too.

anyway, so now i am homeless, i guess, because a loud, mentally retarded man kept putting his hands on me and that is okay but i remove them once and that is not okay because apparently my entire purpose in life is to just quietly be abused by every single person around me and if i ever protest that is unacceptable.

and i just am so fucking tired. my life fell apart when my fiance left me for another man. and again when i found out she would been cheating, that she would hated me for several months, when i would read all of the awful things she would said to me. and then when the one thing i thoughught might make me no longer dependent upon all of these wretched influences in my life, the one thing that might help me find the only thing i ever wanted: a quiet place where i can just exist withoughut being made to feel awful for it, a place where i can just enjoy a little bit of peace and quiet and serenity, had been undermined by people who were persistently maliciously negligent for over an entire year.

and through all of that i managed to maintain some small semblance of hope, some small means of motivating myself from - althoughugh i was not *happy* to be awake, the way i would been for the two and a half years i was in love, and *under the i ampression that i was* loved, at least i was not - dreading opening my eyes at the start of every day.

and i just do not know what else i can do. i am so exhausted. there are so many millions of little things i did not mention because i am incapable of even thinking of all of them now, it is just too much effort to collate that massive encyclopedic volume of memories and mental tally cards of every small injustice and every great betrayal, but that does not mean they do not contribute and it really is just too much.

and there is no more realistic options. i cannot keep this up.

and i am just so fucking tired all of the ti ame.

i do not want much. i just want everyone to stop being so mad at me all the ti ame, so disappointed in me or disgusted with me, so sick of me being around at all. i just want a little place where i can be me and that is okay. where there is peace and quiet and i do not have to fucking feel like i should say sorry every ti ame i take a breath or a step or just for fucking existing like i have had to be for my whole entire life.

869,"third ti ame's a charmthis will likely be my final post so it will probably be a longer one.

&amp;#x200b;

for about 8 years now i have had depression. at first it was not so bad, and came in waves. i was able to get by.

the last 4 years it has gotten significantly worse at an exponential rate, making me go from being the academic who has a plan in life to a failure who barely passed the end of high school. 

n order to live one needs money, and to get money one needs a job. i do not care about have a crazy salary or anything. really anything that lets me live decently comfortably and save for retirement would be fine. however i have run into several roadblocks over the years.

my first roadblock would be my weight. while i do not eat a lot i do not always make the most healthy choices. i have no energy to make my own food and i hate it, plus due to being brought up on fast-food and no vegetables my taste is honestly worst than most children, i cannot stand greens and even if i do force it down my body punishes me for it later. that and after going on a controlled diet for 3 months and only losing 30 pounds (much less than what i should of at my weight) it basically destroyed any will i had left.

my second roadblock is sociability. i am just boring. my motto is always to be a mini amal inconvenience and try and be as patient and nice as possible to others. but i cannot hold a conversation. my interests are niche and i do not have the natural craving for social-interaction so i just end up ghosting people or not saying anything. while people like to say that is fine, i have literally lost interviews because i cannot talk about popular tv shows i do not care about, and i am just unenthusiastic in general.

the final roadblock is depression. this has ruined me. i have lost my smarts, i have worsened my weight, it really has taken two requirements for life and pushed them out. i do not have the energy to fight the weight anymore, it is not going up, but it is not going down. i have said this in previous posts but even if depression did not exist for me suddenly i would be 2+ years away from being healthy, which is just too much ti ame i do not have do dedicate to that. i have also lost all interest in everything, so i do not even know what i want to do for a living at all, and my attempts to find careers have all been futile.

at this point in life i am really just done. i am only 20 but there is nothing left for me to do. i have tried reaching out to others to see if a job exists where i do not need to be social, fit, or smart, but you basically need at least one of thoughse to get one. they usually say ""oh you do not need to be like friends with your co-workers, just nice"" or ""you had be surprised how smart you actually are"". no. i have experience to back my points, it is not just in my head. sure you may not need to be friends with your co-workers, but a lot of people equate being nice to being personable. my grades, and my ability to interview have shown me enough about my smarts. plus i as i have said i do not have the energy in interest in doing a smart-person job anyways.

so as the title suggests this is my third ti ame trying. this ti ame i am changing the methoughd to something with a better success rate. bye everyone,  i hope you all find your place in the world, where i could not.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

872,"how can i tell if i am depressed/suicidal?dumb as fuck question you are thinking, right?

let me explain.

i am a college student. 19. i often do not know if what i am thinking are my own thoughughts, ideals, attitudes, stances etc. i feel so influenced by my life of harvesting media and opinions of others since i spend so much ti ame at home on the interight nowet, having no social life outside of my ti ame on campus. i have no friend 'group', i have friends dotted here and there, but i am not sure i would call them 'friends' since the moment i leave college, it is as if i do not exist. so i have definitely come to the truly *genius* conclusion that i am extremely lonely, despite living with both my parents and my brother. would i ever tell them? god no, for many reasons. i think they know anyway, since it is been months since i have gone out for anything other than college. i feel shit daily, which leads me to believe i am depressed, or maybe i wish i was more depressed.

now, why am i confused whether or not i am depressed or suicidal? i often think suicidal thoughughts, such as , ""fuck i wish i would just go home and fucking die, end it all"". someti ames as i walk home i think that today's the day, i am just going to go home and do it. i think about ways in which to do it, obsess about my brother coming home and finding me, but then i ammediately think ""**lol**, fuck that, dying would suck, life is better than death no matter what"". make a joke about it, then think, ""woah, what if i *am* suicidal"". i often believe i am interested with the *idea* of being suicidal, whilst not actually being suicidal. i am positive i will never kill myself, but i think about it every single day. so what do *real* suicidal people think? i have read posts on here from suicidal people and i wonder how many, if any, think the same way as i do? what the actual fuck is wrong with me",depression,suicide,0.90

 my mom has a history with supplements and herbal medicines and is very adverse to the idea due to all the horror stories about them. my big sister who i am also close with thinks they can help some people that do not have any other option. i am personally toright now because they seem artificial in the way they treat the brain but i am not sure if there are many natural remedies left to try. i live in the northwest so i am getting a light for seasonal affective disorder(sad).

893,"how mdma helped my depressionlet me start off by saying that this is by no means a cure-all. my depression has not been cured, but i have learight nowed to look at it in a different way which has greatly lessened it is severity. also, i should express the caveat that this drug can be dangerous if taken in too large amounts, taken in combination with other substances, or if it is cut with something, so always test your drugs and do your research in advance!!! 

my history of use with this drug has been pretty strange. i have almost always taken it in a rave-like setting, with techno music playing in the background (i do not even like techno music that much). anyways, we tested the mdma the day before we go to this dj's set and it is very pure and very safe. we ingest .2 grams of the substance on an empty stomach before we go to the venue. normally on this substance, i just feel really really good, but this ti ame transcended that. as soon as it kicked in my friend and i went outside instead of dancing and started having a conversation on this substance. we ended up being completely open and honest with each other in a way that is completely different from alcohol (what i mean by this is that we were not embarrassed about anything we said the next day). i realized then that this drug is not meant to be taken at raves or dance parties, that this substance is a catalyst for open, inti amate, and honest conversation. it was like 3 years worth of therapy wrapped into a 2-hour conversation, and it felt more genuine because my friend and i actually cared about each other and as opposed to just getting paid to do this. we barely spent any ti ame in the club, just talked outside smoking cigarettes. i opened up about my past and my family and he opened up about his and i felt this genuine connection to this friend that i loved. now when i am depressed, i think that no one really likes me and that i do not have any true friends, but on this substance i saw that that was a total delusion fabricated by my mind. i told myself ""okay, you are just on a drug, you are out of it"". but i realized that my intellect was not effected in the least by this substance. i could still do math problems, talk about esoteric topics, etc. the only difference was this clarity of emotion that i never knew was possible, and that has stayed with me a little bit to this day. it made me realize that i do in fact have friends, and they are just as fucked up as i am so there is nothing i need to hide from them. it made me realize that everyone has problems, and not just in an abstract, conceptual way. we, as depressed people, just put a magnifying glass on our problems so that it is the only thing we see.

i am not advocating drug use, merely sharing a profound experience of openness that i would have not known could exist had i not taken this substance. mdma is fun at raves and whatnot, but i do not think i will ever do it in that environment again. what i got out of a 2 hour conversation outside of this club was more profound than anything that was going on inside. i hope this was of some help, as experiences that are this intense are difficult to express in words.",depression,depression,0.90

895,"living in sorrow.not sure where to start or if anyone will read through this whole thing (but if you do, i owe you a cookie.. or a .. golden horse statue). not going to bother with a throwaway account.. it will just make me feel like i am hiding from all of this even more. 

so.. here we go. i am depressed. probably even more than i would like to admit. i consider myself an introvert. and i think it is a large reason why i hold so much in and tend to keep to myself. i can easily make friends.. but i tend to keep them at a distance. i did not use to do that but i did not have that great of a childhood nor teenage years. my family fought a lot and i was always just kind of there.. trying to occupy myself and drown out the noise of my parents fighting or my mother and older brother getting into it. my parents divorced when i was around 11 (i am 28 now). which is okay because i have a good relationship with both of them and was able to see them whenever i wanted. even when i was younger i knew it was better they separated.

my teenage years were not that great either, i was picked on a lot for my looks (told i looked like a guy or that i was ugly - which to this day still knocks at me a bit), been walked on and used (always being told it was my fault for being ""too nice"") and also never dated or had sex until i was in my early twenties.. probably due to the fact my confidence was lacking. 

then around age 18 after graduating high school i started community college. i was there a few years, took basic courses since i was never sure what i wanted to go into. i ended up dropping out due to anxiety with full ti ame classes and a full ti ame job. i worked overight nowights at the ti ame then went to class in the moright nowings and after a while it just buright nowed me out so i decided to take a ""break"". about 8 years later i am still on that break.. always thinking of going back but never getting much farther than gathering my transcripts.. still not sure what i want to do.. althoughugh i have done art since i was a child and have a deep love for it.

around the ti ame that i quit college, i met someone who would end up being my best friend. i met her on a music chatroom of one of my favorite bands at the ti ame. we talked for quite awhile, and i learight nowed that she was good friends with one of the band members [i will never say who, please respect this]. i was introduced and the rest is history. we all became so close to the point it felt like the universe was in our hands. we all lived in different states but it was like we could feel the heart of the others. the woman and man fell in love with each other. and then i fell in love with her. but due to different circumstances, it was all too complicated to actually work out. 

the past 10 years we have been in and out of each other's lives, something i do not think i could explain with all the words that exist, nor the ti ame. as much as it was wonderful, it was also full of heartache. distance being the biggest hell. but these days we are all living different lives and not talking very much.. and i do not have a doubt in my mind that i am the only one still hanging onto it. but lives change, people change. everyone knows that. but that connection.. i do not think i could ever have that with anyone ever again. it was magic. too good to be true.. which is why i believe it is gone.

now, during all of this, i tried dating here and there. but i always broke it off because my mind was always on thoughse two friends. my heart was always far away. so i stayed single.. not a huge deal to me.. in my head, my heart was taken anyway.. just with people who were far away. but one can only be satisfied with that for so long.. and none of us moved to the others because of our separate lives (family, jobs, kids). now it is but a dream (now i have that stupid fucking row row row your boat song stuck in my head).

if you are still reading this, i appreciate you and commend you.. you are getting closer to that cookie/horse.

obviously i cannot explain every thing i would like to, as i said it is nearly i ampossible to sum up so many years in such a small amount of words. now, i told you how i was in love with this woman, which i will mention that i have never before nor after been attracted to women but you cannot help who you fall in love with. but, there is someone else who has somehow found their way through my thick and heavy heart. however, this is another person i cannot have due to circumstances. someone i have known for years and always had something for but never told hi am until recently. nothing can ever happen of it thoughugh because neither hi am nor i would ever fuck up what he has. i mention this because it feels like love is hopeless to me. somehow i keep falling for people i cannot have. it is not easy for me by any means to feel emotionally or sexually attracted towards just anyone. in fact the only people i have are the ones in the situation i am describing. i am not sure what it is.. but it must be me. i know that much. as i said, i cannot control my feelings but i can control my actions. i tend to over-analyze everything.. tear it apart.. over-worry. all for what? things i cannot get out of my mind. i have been suicidal in the past from depression, but i am not that way now (no suicidal tendencies) but i am quite down right   now. just an overall feeling of loneliness, exhaustion, heartache. i battle depression on top of my already existing depression. 

one of my escapes is skateboarding, but i recently fractured my ankle so i cannot even do that (also i am frequently told it is ti ame to ""grow up"" and quit skating but i have been doing it for 18 years and you truly cannot understand unless you skate yourself). i am currently off work on short-term disability for it which means i have nothing but ti ame right now for all of these thoughughts to demolish my insides.

i suppose i have written enough for now.. any advice to help relieve myself of pain is welcome. and therapy has been mentioned but i guess i am scared to.. althoughugh hell.. i realize i just opened up to all of you so why not one more stranger? fuck i do not know.. but i have to pee.",depression,depression,0.90

901,"it never got better for me.earlier this year i was hospitalized because i wanted to kill myself. all the pressures in my life built up and pushed me to my breaking point. i cried for an hour on the phone with various people at the suicide hotline who eventually extracted my address and dispatched police who would take me to the hospital. i could not go through with it that night. i was scared. i was brought to the hospital and put in the emergency unit. i remember the officer who stuck with me through that hole experience, a lovely person who could only say the most positive things about me to my parents as they left at the late hours of the moright nowing. i saw a psych nurse and the er doctor that night and that was it. the next moright nowing i was visited by a number of doctors and psychiatrists who placed me under certifications that would prevent me from leaving for 30 days or until they cancelled my certification. from there i was moved to an adolescent unit at a different hospital (i am not an adult). there my parents talked with the nurses and doctors about what treatments i could expect. i asked them not to leave me there. 

for 5 days i stayed at that unit and tried my best to participate and just go along with what they wanted. i hated it there. i hated everyone there. my parents would take me out constantly. i hated that. they would sit with me in the lobby of the hospital or some restaurant down the street and ask me how i was. if i felt better and how they could understand it. i did not want to answer that. thoughse conversations only lead to me feeling guilty and ashamed of myself. i would check into the hospital again right before they would send everyone to bed and lay there on my bed hating myself. after everyone had fallen asleep and the lights were off and my insomniac and schizophrenic roommates finished shuffling around the room i would stare at the ceiling and chew at my lip whispering curses into the dry hospital air. i knew that there was no way i could get back to my life where i was. the cbt and pointless group sessions they put me through only acted as a distraction to my social life, school, and relationships with my family which were busy atrophying after i stopped talking to everyone the night i was brought into the hospital. i vowed that i would do whatever it took to get out of that miserable hospital and back to my life. faking happiness and lying through my teeth.

i saw my girlfriend once, we went to dinner. we had missed valentine's day. we both thoughught it was stupid but i still felt bad for putting her through everything. she knew i was in the hospital. i also saw my best friend. he chatted with me for a long while and was a better support than anything i was receiving at that point. after the dinner date with my girlfriend she handed me an envelope as we parted ways. reading the letter inside i held back tears and avoided the questions of my father who was very conceright nowed by what i was not showing. i assured hi am it was nothing and went to sleep crying clutching that note to my chest. it was an apology. an apology for not being there. she was blaming herself. it was almost my last day. the psychiatrists finally felt like coming back to work and i was let out of the hospital. 

for weeks after that i tried to seem normal and act like i was better. if i showed even the slightest shift in mood my parents would be at my side weeping wondering what was wrong and if i was safe. it continues to this day, a torture worse than the disguised isolation of the hospital. i tell them i am fine. i see a psychiatrist for follow up now. i have seen several counselors before i was let into the hospital too but they were obviously not that helpful. she seems to have the potential to help me but she is not interested in hearing my past. a past spanning years of bullying, depression, and the loss of trust and friends. i wish she knew it all because no one does. i am the only one who has all this information. like a cipher for a code i feel like nobody can understand me withoughut this extensive background of who i really am. it is miserable and it is making the counseling worthless.

i only actually missed 3 days of school because the rest of my hospitalization overlapped a school break. due to this it was not feasible to take an easier class load from what was already a difficult semester. i say that but it really is not that hard. terrible motivation and procrastination brought about my an apathy for everything has tainted any hope i have of succeeding in life, getting into post-secondary or even graduating. i elected for my teachers not to know what happened to me and so they are unwilling to be lenient. i am too afraid to talk to them. no matter what people seem to say to me depression is a taboo. i informed several of my friends what was happening because i did not want my family and closest friends to be bombarded by the questions regarding where i was. i ammediately after doing this i had people telling me what a bad idea it was to share this information. this knowledge does not seem to damage the surface of my relationships but it has effectively ruined them all.

my closest friend is more distant than ever, rarely responding to me or ever being available. he suffers from his own depression and anxiety and i try to support hi am as best i can but he is turight nowing away from me. my family does not trust me anymore. they do not like leaving me alone and constantly perform pointless check ups on me that do not teach them anything and only give me another opportunity to lie an feel ashamed. worst of all my relationship with my girlfriend has only further suffered. her anxiety has only become worse and i think she is falling into depression the same way i have. after almost nine months of dating her and an even longer ti ame knowing her she has never said she loves me. affection and inti amacy have always been a problem between us and it is gotten worse. recently she has told me that her anxiety has worsened, affection is nauseating to her and she can barely overcome her fears of the possible. she wants medication or a si ample fix but avoids getting any professional help. i try to support her but she does not believe that i have dealt with si amilar things or that her problems are very real and she should get the help she needs. i someti ames fear that it is not real or that it is just her subtle and gentle way of ending our relationship. this is not my only evidence for this belief either but i will not share it all here.

coming out of all of this i realize i am not fixed. i am not better. i am empty and hopeless and want to die. i cannot deal with the most basic of stresses and deadlines withoughut severe anxiety, no functioning human should exist like that. the only difference now from before is that it is even harder to kill myself because i have had so many people tell me how hard it would hit them. i am a broken, damaged person who is not contributing or benefiting anyone, only dragging down the people he tries to care for. i should be using my therapy sessions better, i should be taking anti-depressants. my one argument and moral objection to medication is a total lie. i do not want to rely on a chemical to change how i fell but i do it all the ti ame myself. i went on a streak where i was drinking every weekend i could and now use adderall to try to find at least some motivation and concentration for the bare mini amum of my responsibilities. it is all a farce and i am tired of living it. i wish something exteright nowal could end it gracefully so that people would not have to know that i ignored their pleas and finally killed myself. 

if you made it this far i do not know what to tell you. i have heard every reason and dream that could stop someone from ending it. every calming voice telling me it is not that big of a deal and i will get over it eventually. it has not felt better for the past 3 years and it is showing no chance of i amproving. i can barely sleep, i am rarely eating, every relationship i have is collapsing and i am failing school. i do not know what i expected from posting this here.

908,"i cannot do this.
i am 24 years old and i am a complete human failure.

i graduated high school in 2006 and i have yet to earight now a degree. i am in community college and i feel like i have been wasting my ti ame. when i started, i made the fatal mistake of failing virtually every class due to a combination of procrastination, distractions and possibly undiagnosed depression. at my worst, i ended up with a 0.8 gpa and no financial aid. i am doing a lot better now; i have made up most of my classes, beefed up my gpa i ammensely, got some aid back and now have a clear view of what i want to pursue academically (transfer to a 4-year). however, that does not stop me from doubting about my future. i often find myself thinking thoughughts like ""i made a lot of mistakes in college. it does not matter if you have gotten you are shit together. in the real world, you you will be competing against people with amazing gpas and years of entry level experience. what makes you think that you can even compete against these people?"" this pessi amistic attitude contributed to my horrible failures as a student and they still haunt me. why even try when i am doomed from the start? i know i should not think like this, but here he are.

i have thoughught a lot about if i even belong in college in the first place. unfortunately, leaving college for an alteright nowative solution,like a trade school, is not an option. i currently live with my parents who like to believe that a college degree is this magical golden ticket that will get you any job you want, no questions asked. my dad often criticizes me for being in college for so long with nothing to show for it. he also likes to criticize me when i take courses that are not stem related, even if they are gen. education related. even if i am doing better in school, i cannot help but feel like since my father never got to go to college, i have to fulfill the college dream for hi am. being the child of mexican i ammigrants also contributes to that stressful obligation. i know i messed up my life and i am trying to make up for it, but he just does not see that. i could not even suggest dropping out of college to pursue something else because he will pull the eviction card. i cannot afford to live on a part ti ame mini amum wage salary so i am stuck.

then there are the social,and possibly mental, issues. for as long as i can remember, i have always had this feeling of, well, just feeling depressed. i have always felt not worthy of anything i got in life. because of this, there are ti ames when i do not even try to do what i am supposed to.

i am 24, why bother studying when most employers will laugh me out of the office for taking so long to graduate-and with little to no experience even! it is always been hard to trust people for me. why bother talking to thoughse people when they just ignore me or worse? they already have better friends. what the fuck do you have to offer? i grew up with little friends who i always thoughught just talked to me out of pity. fuck, even my first and only girlfriend only dated me to forget about her previous boyfriend. i cannot date women because i am a possible mental fuckup who lives with his mom and goes to community college at 24 and who still works at a shit mini amum wage job with the social skills of a wet bag. what the fuck do i offer to any woman i fancy that better men cannot?

why not just fucking give up? why not just admit defeat, admit that i am and always be a fucking loser and just end myself? all i can see in my future is a bitter life of loneliness, poverty and guilt. why not end the pain?

i am sorry about the rambling nature of this post. i have only gotten like 4 hours of sleep. basically, am i fucked? should i resign to the fact that i am doomed an idiot loser with parent issues who will never afford therapy? is there hope?

913,"this breakup is tearing my heart right apart and making me have thoughughts of dying, help?backstory: i met this girl about 7 or 8 months ago and she was in half of my classes, for privacy we will call her monica, i did not know monica that well because she is a new student and althoughugh she was new she was more popular than me, in one of our classes we were allowed to use our phones for the period so we played some 8ball together, an old friend of mine who i have known for 2 years who is also a girl, we will call her rebecca, she invited me to walk from school to a park near my home with monica, rebecca, and i, i accepted and a day later rebecca tells me that monica had a crush on me, at the ti ame i was dating a girl, who we are going to call erika, erika and i were not very serious because the only ti ame i saw her was on my school bus and we did not hangout a lot, we did not talk a lot, basically no communication. i find out monica has a crush on me and i did not think much of it. a few days later and it is the day we are walking to the park. turight nows out rebecca cannot go anymore so it was just me and monica (by coincidence) so we start walking and we are having lots of fun and we are enjoying ourselves and ya know day goes by and it was fun, i started to develop feelings for monica, this was in march btw so it was very close to spring break for me, spring break comes by and i ask monica's two best friends if she likes me just to verify, they both say yes, withoughut thinking about erika, i ask out monica and she says yes, but then asks me about erika, a few days go by and i was planning on breaking up with her in person on the bus, i was too i ampatient so i do it on snapchat, 3 days before spring break ends we go to a baright nowes and noble and we just sit down in one of the isles and talk, probably one of the most romantic settings because we are both very comfortable and we are open to talk, i forgot to tell her i broke up with erika so she proceeds to tell me to go back with erika, i tell her the news and she says “noooo go back with her” needless to say i was confused so i assured her that i wanted her, she had very deep hatred for herself, and as do i, so we argue abt erika and all that bs, tell her idc anymore and i am with you now so it is too late, 3 months go by and everything was going smooth until she started telling me that she does not deserve me and that you need to leave me before you get hurt, tell her idc i am in love with her (i really am) and it stops there.


fast forward to this week and i am in universal with my family, monica tells me we need a break, i do not feel like i am in the right state of mind and we need a break. i am confused but i tell her that sure we can have a break because i want to be nice and give her ti ame and space to think, she and i joke about how we are not dating anymore (for some reason we were still texting even though she wanted a break) she said we can get back together when the new school year starts, i say “i cannot wait for school to start”, she asks why, i say “i was going to save this for later but i am going to ask you out on the first day of school”, she says could you please not, i am confused as fuck, “i am going to say no because i do not want you getting to attached to me and i do not want to hurt you” i do not understand how she is hurting me? “do not ask me out”, we have a whole argument abt how she does not like me anymore and she ends it by saying “if i knew you were going to be like this i would have never dated you” that is where my heart shattered into pieces and she says “maybe we were just meant to be friends” i am still texting her today, she fell asleep an hour ago but this had got me thinking i did something wrong, i told her to block me on everything and try and forget i existed, i ammediately regret that. now i am sitting here thinking about killing myself in a hotel in florida

i am in my mid forties, and have managed to keep depression mostly at bay with exercise and playing music. tried therapy and drugs decades ago. utter bullshit for me.

one constant has been an inner duality; a version of myself inside myself that both is and is not me. (shit this is hard to articulate)

i cannot identify or ""see"" hi am, but he reveals hi amself in all my shame and failures. not sure, but maybe i fabricated this abstraction to deflect accountability for my flaws and misdeeds? if i do something i am ashamed of, *he* did it. failed at something in the past? it was hi am. weakness? procrastination? yep, hi am again.

positive achievements and enjoyment does not hurt hi am, but he does not get the credit for them. i do it to spite hi am. in fact, i get great satisfaction out of showing hi am i am not his bitch by getting up early, working hard, being magnani amous, just generally doing the right an proper thing. like he gives me a shitty smirk and crosses his arms and waits for an opening to fuck me up.

but this recent failure made me question hi am. is he holding me back? my feelings for hi am lay somewhere beyond hatred. it is not that he is evil and i hate hi am. he is me, so how would that work? i am getting to this point in my life, mid-life crisis or whatever, where i realize how much ti ame and opportunity was squandered. i want to get all i can out of what life is left. is this duality holding me back? 

if i were to kill hi am, would i be able to shoulder the burden of my failures and flaws? would i really be in control? would not i just manufacture some other excuse when i am tired or bored? 

or do i embrace hi am, and hold hi am so closely and tightly that he is forced to abide by my will? same thing as killing hi am i guess, but maybe i need hi am close to me. maybe i *cannot* kill hi am. i mean, what would i do to kill hi am anyway?

i cannot tell if this makes any sense to anyone or not, which is why i am posting this and hoping maybe someone has a word or two to help untangle this.

946,"ok so i have been diving into microcontroller recently. how hex code dumps work and the like


that reminded me of a question that has been plaguing me for a long ti ame. serial communication between computers 


ley me take a si ample scenario. some random microcontroller and a computer that reads in text from the mc serially . 


asynchronous communication being a thing means that both of the devices need not run at the same clock from what i have been told. my computer can chug along at whatever clockspeed it wants and my microcontroller can coast at the few mhz of clock speed 


from what i understand, both systems however agree on a common baud rate. in other words, microcontroller goes : ""hey man, i am going to scream some text 9600 ti ames a second""


the pc goes ""hey man, i will hear your screaming 9600 ti ames a second""


obviously, if these numbers were different, we get garbled output. but this is precisely what confuses me. what goveright nows the baud rate on the microcontroller is a ti amer loop running 9600ish ti ames a second that interrupts and sends data across


note the usage of 9600ish. if the ti amer is 16bit and the mc is clocked at xyz mhz for example, the exact values i need to tell the ti amer to run the loop for differ compared to if the clock was some other value (assuming the cpu of the mc drives the ti amer, like in a microcontroller i have seen online)


this means whatever baud rate i get will not be exactly 9600 but somewhere close enough


the pc on the other hand? even if its clock was constant, the non-exact 9600 baud rate from the mc side will be trouble enough, causing a mismatch in transmission over ti ame. 


it is like two runners who run at almost the same pace, passing something back and forth. eventually, one overtakes or falls behind the other enough that whatever they are passing gets messed up


moderight now pcs too can change their clock speed on a whi am, so in the ti ame it takes for the pc to change its clock and thus update the ti amer accordingly, the baud rate shifts ever so slightly from 9600, enough to cause a mismatch



how does this never cause problems in the real world thoughugh? computers can happily chug along speaking to each other at a set baud rate withoughut this mismatch ever being a problem


for clarification, i am referring to the uart protocol here",noise,noise data,0.95

however, being unloved? my capacity to deal with being ignored is pretty much nonexistant. when i am in a situation in which i feel lonely, i reach out. i have gotten better at fulfilling that need with reaching out to friends just chat about whatever instead of my problems, as my problems scare people. however, whenever i get close enough to be open with someone, they eventually leave me. right now, my best friend is not speaking to me (after like 6 months of slowly replacing me in her life with her boyfriend, despite the fact that i am pretty fucking sure it is possible to have more than one friend...). when i tried to talk about it, she told me that my need to talk to people is not normal. that really fucking hurt my feelings, like reaching out is such a bad thing?

unfortunately, and here's where the failure came in, i could not just be ignored like a normal person. nope. i have been freaking the fuck out for the last week and i cannot stop crying because damn it i think i lost my best friend. this is the 4th ti ame in about two years that this has happened. i probably made here feel bad, which does not help situations. i have reached out to other friends, and they have been supportive, but i bet they are going to get sick of this episode soon too. i am an ass when i hit a low.

i feel all alone, and i need people, but the people i need most do not want me. please help me get out of this mess.",depression,depression,0.90

i am always down. i have a good amount of friends but nobody ever reaches out to me. it hurts. the effort i put in the relationships is never reciprocated. 


i am 32/m. my dad hung hi amself when i was a teenager. my mother died of a brain tumor in 2007. got married. had two kids. got divorced and lost everything after a 2+ year legal battle. house was foreclosed on. i have my kids 50% of the ti ame. live in a small apartment now. i have tourettes. constantly tired all the ti ame. i am a software developer. feel like a shell of a person. i often wish i did not exist, but i trudge thru life because i know the pain that suicide brings to loved ones. i could not do that to my kids. i am on antidepressants. i see a therapist. but what i want are friendly connections. 


i do the best i can to be a good dad. my kids love me. i do everything i can to hide the pain i have inside. suicide and depression run in my family, so that sucks. i am trying to keep my head up, but it is hard when you are in a void with no social support. (again, not suicidal. just down)

my new psychiatrist has a methoughd where he looks at family photos of older and younger versions of parents, siblings and myself. individual photos and interacting-with-one-another photos. sibling partners, my partners etc.

from what i am gathering he looks at the photos, looks for si amilarities in appearance, moods and familial interactions in the photos. see's if there is si amilarities with partner choice amongst siblings etc. see's if i am happy as a kid, how my bro's and sis's looked etc.

to me it sounds a little pseudosciencey, but i kind of trust hi am as his approach is convincing, being he will be able to empathically connect with photos (as i someti ames do, and i am sure others do when looking at old photos) and be able to draw conclusions from them about how i turight nowed out the way i did.

957,"so, i read a lot, like most folks in this subreddit, and i have really tried to read more from authoughrs around the world. i am no linguist, so i am forced to read the english translations of these works, but i have found some interesting patteright nows in world literature that i thoughught i might share. i find that various languages really lend themselves to different types of writing mediums and styles. obviously these are very broad generalizations, just my experience. 

-english is an incredibly vocabulary heavy language, borrowing from virtually every other language at this point. their champion is the novel, to no one's surprise with writers like dickens or austen. english literature tends to be wordy but not verbose, it just usually requires that many words to adequately describe what you are referring to. english novels tend to be morally driven, as opposed to character or plot driven. 

 -more than english, i think the novel is really best expressed through indian and russian literature. tamil is believed to have the largest vocabulary of any language, but more than that both russia and india have incredibly rich folklore backgrounds. both cultures prize plot over other elements of the book, and both culture's works frequently have casts in the hundreds. for me, and indian novel is always full of high drama and tragedy, withoughut falling into being goofy. russian literature, especially tolstoy, is often same, with others like dostoevsky or turgenev being more inward facing. the one real split between these two is that the russians tend to write philosophically more than the indians. 

-french literature is (as is almost stereotypically french) emotional. hugo, proust, dumas, etc. all cut to your heart and beg you for a passionate experience. plot comes secondarily but organically to the relationships between characters. french literature speaks to your heart. 

-korean literature is, to me, akin to the historic differences between film and television. while the latter evolved from radio and storytelling, the former was derived from photography and was about striking visuals. korean literature will never say 10 words when 1 would suffice. korean books tend to be very short but evocative, creating an ambiance that you live in rather than a plot that you pursue. it is very peaceful and often very melancholic. 

-japanese literature is both si amilar to korean and completely different. the japanese focus more on plot and often have significantly larger novels, but compared with westeright now literature it is still not what i would consider plot driven. instead, japanese literature meanders, taking the reader where it chooses in a zig zag, loop de loop path that can often be hard to follow. there is no 3 act structure, but that is not to say that japanese literature is lost, only that you may feel lost while in it. it still resolves and you see that every detail was almost always planned from the start. 

-irish literature tends to be short and playful. rules get thrown out of the window. joyce is of course the poster child for irish writing, but beckett or toibin also play with form and give you shocking experiences withoughut you having realized. with irish writing i would not say plot or characters are the pri amary goals, but rather the story is. irish writing always feels as thoughugh someone is sitting in front of you telling you a story, one you cannot always follow, but one they insist upon. i love it. 

again, these are broad strokes and only a few cultures are discussed. i am curious what others think thoughugh and what other si amilar patteright nows can be found in other cultures' works. ",noise,noise data,0.95

962,"how do i get hi am to understand?hi, reddit. this is my first post after a year of lurking. a little about me: i was diagnosed with anxiety and depression last september and have been taking antidepressants practically ever since. i have gone to two different therapists, and althoughugh beneficial, feel that i have overcome the worst and ceased counseling. that is not to say everything is fine and dandy - i still have my ups and downs.

i am not sure if this is the correct community to seek advice but i may as well try.

i find that as of late, my boyfriend has become... overbearing. he is a great guy and i love hi am to pieces but our differences have been butting heads. he is a workaholic, always productive and motivated. and then there is me, caught in that vicious cycle we are all familiar with (http://i amgur.com/qehxs).

ulti amately, i want to produce a graphic novel. i have pages of concept sketches and character designs, outlines and ideas but have yet to move on to the next step. my boyfriend strives to be a screenwriter and is a film student. he moved to the us from south america just to live out his dreams. he is written a handful of features and is always jotting down notes for another story.

at the end of the day, we 'compare notes'. and when i tell hi am i have not done anything, he becomes frustrated and upset. just now i finished a call from hi am and he was basically lecturing me. i understand where he is coming from but it is hard for me to put into words just what i feel and what i am struggling with. i feel as thoughugh i can never live up to his expectations, am completely overwhelmed whenever he brings up the same speech, that i need to do more... i have told hi am that someti ames i am under the i ampression he does not accept me for me.

he knows i have depression but i feel as thoughugh he does not quite grasp the concept of not having the energy to stay focused on something. i become utterly speechless when trying to share what i feel but even thoughse emotions leave me at a loss. our communication is at a disconnect and the only thing i can do is cry and ask to be left alone.

i do draw some things now and then. it feels good for me to do something, no matter how little, but it is as if he sees me as a machine that can just spew these things with ease. my passion for art has not been the same since 2006 and even i get incredibly angry that i cannot be excited to make something like i used to be.

964,"one thing i have learight nowed recently: nobody is too busy unless they choose to be.
think about it—some of the busiest people in the world do not even describe themselves as “busy.” why? because they plan, they prioritize, and they know what matters.

someti ames, we stay “busy” because it feels safer than slowing down.

ask yourself:

is your packed schedule a form of avoidance?

does being busy make you feel more i amportant?

does it give you a reason to say ""no"" to people or plans you had rather avoid?

are you using “busy” as a shield from your own emotions?


if planning and scheduling feels unmanageable, start with this si ample habit:
each moright nowing, write down your top 5 essential tasks.
focus on only thoughse. no guilt. no extra fluff. just progress.

let us also confront the emotional side of busyness. someti ames, we cling to full calendars because they give us a sense of worth. instead, let us build genuine confidence by:

creating things we are proud of

getting better at something we love

setting clear boundaries in relationships

giving ourselves permission to rest


busyness does not equal value. clarity does. focus does. being aligned with your goals does.

so i am curious… what is your relationship with being busy?
are you learight nowing to slow down, or still stuck in the cycle?
let us have an honest discussion—how do you manage your ti ame, energy, and priorities?

share your experiences, tips, or even struggles. we are all figuring this out together.

974,"after reading a bunch of dense, complex literary classics, i have been looking for a major change of pace towards something easier and more ""fun"". i used to be a big tom clancy (rip) fan back in my youth and had devoured most of the early jack ryan/john clark books. he really started to fall off after rainbow six but i have fond memories of the late 80s/early 90s stuff. 

red storm rising, however, is one of the major works that i had never gotten around to. mostly because at the ti ame when i was in my clancy phase, i was really just interested in the jack ryan stuff. i recently came across a used copy of it at a thrift store and decided to give it a go. 

and man, i have really been sleeping on this one because after devouring it over the course of a week, i think this just might be clancy's best work, along with withoughut remorse. it is the best encapsulation of what clancy really excels in, which is the rigorous, grounded technical detail of a ""what if"" military situation. althoughugh on paper it is dated as it takes place in the 80s and deals with a conflict with the ussr, in practice it is still a thrilling read because of a) the aforementioned technical detail and comprehensive research on how such a scenario would play out from a logistical standpoint and b) due to recent events in which russia is being a bit of a dick to its neighbouring countries.

althoughugh it is a chunky doorstopper, the book is paced really well, with some pretty amazing military action set pieces sprinkled throughout. these have always been clancy's bread and butter, and they are probably at their best here. 

with that being said - clancy is still clancy and his well-documented weaknesses are pretty evident here as well. the prose is functional at best and the characters are not really anything to write home about - they mostly exist to move the plot along. dialogue is perfunctory and workmanlike, and again, it mostly consists of people commenting on whatever military action is currently taking place or will take place. but really, i do not think anyone is reading clancy expecting high art and any kind of profound literary merit.

luckily thoughugh this book was before he went full right-wing rah-rah murica the best in the late 90s so politically speaking it does not feel as gross. 

if you take it for what it is thoughugh - an extremely well-thoughught out and exhaustively researched war world iii scenario with great action and attention to detail - it is a damn good read. ",noise,noise data,0.95

993,"i have decided to start reading more non-fiction books this year. stories of real people always fascinated me and it is always amazing to see how they convey their experiences through words and ink. i read i know why the caged bird sings by maya angelou last month and it is by far one of the best autobiographies i have come across so far.

this book is the first one from the series about her life and covers her life from childhood till the birth of her son. from the very first pages, i i ammediately became interested in maya's story and the more i read, the more i felt like i knew her. it was like reading about a dear old friend.

maya's life had not been easy. from a young age, her and her brother, bailey, experienced the pain of abandonment when their parents sent them to live with their grandma in stamps, a small southeright now town. their life in this small community, althoughugh not luxurious, it was comfortable and provided maya with a sense of comfort and familiarity. from a very young age she developed a love for reading and writing, to which she would devote her life later on.

everything changed once maya and bailey's mother decided to take them with her to st. louis. bailey was ecstatic to live with his mom but maya was reluctant to abandon the place she called home. during this period, one of the worst events in her life occurred - she was raped by her mother's partner.

my heart panged for eight years old maya. she was so confused and afraid. the portrayal of the aftermath and what happened after her rapist's conviction made me want to cry. she had to keep it secret because that monster had threatened to kill bailey and maya, who loved her brother so much, spoke no word. after that, she became a shell of her own self. she avoided talk and the only person with whom she felt comfortable talking to was her brother.

throughout her life, maya had experienced racism. a particular event that made my blood boil was when a white dentist, whom her grandmother had helped in the past, refused to treat her painful tooth ache because of their color. i literally saw red. but maya did not succumb. determined and strong spirited, she learight nowt to endure hate and not bow in front of white folks -whom she strongly disliked. i cheered for her when she managed to secure a job as a streetcar conductor -the first black woman in san francisco to do so, mind you!

speaking of racism, what surprised me is the portrayal of racism from black people towards asians in the '40s, when maya and bailey moved to san francisco to live again with their mother. ww2 had a great i ampact in the asian community of the city and that lead to black people's rise in economy. althoughugh they did not abuse asians in the same way whites treated black people, they still treated them in an inferior way, especially after gaining financial power. i know that this is an insignificant part in maya's story but i found it interesting that she did not shy away from showing how abused people will seek to stand above weaker ones, once they gain the upper hand.

family relationships was one of the most prominent themes in the book. throughout my read, i found the parts about maya's interaction with her family to be very emotional. she loved her grandma and uncle, even thoughugh they showed it in different ways. she struggled to reconnect with her mother, treating her as a stranger, only to warm up and even look up to her. their relationship was oh, so complex and yet so beautiful. but the relationship i adored was the one with her brother. as someone who has a sibling, i related with maya's love and devotion to bailey. the siblings were close to each other and even when they argued, they still cared.

i loved maya's prose. the writing was mostly si ample but in some parts it became lyrical and beautiful. there was beauty even in sadness and sorrow. the descriptions of the places and people were very vivid and there were so many extracts that made me pause and think for a moment. 

althoughugh the book has many sad moments, there is also so much hope and opti amism. it reminds us that we need to work to make a better life for ourselves and that we should not allow anyone and anything to take our will to live. the jouright nowey is not easy. but the outcome will be worth.

i really admired angelou. i really did. a strong, independent woman, who loved her family and who sought a better life. despite the hardships she had endured, she did not back down and she managed to navigate in her life, no matter where she was or with whom. i am more than eager to read the rest of her biographies and it is certain to say that i have found a new role model.

we met when she moved from out of state because of her past life. 

she came from a small town where everyone knew everyone, but there was the things parents never knew, but she told me... one of the things she told me early on was that she got caught up in drugs and alcohol because of an ex of hers, who constantly cheated on her because she didnt want to have sex. well eventually he got her drunk enough to make her pass out, and he raped her(if you do not believe it is rape, use the motto ""if they cannot say yes, it is a no.""), she found out later from a friend who he bragged about it to. 

she started dating one guy right as she moved, because that guy reminded her of her ex...well it lasted less than a month because i came in and swept her off her feet, she was always staring at me.... so we started dating and it was fun and perfect until recently, we had some rough patches, but we always made it through. we always worked well with each other, and since i oppose drugs and alcohol, i got her to stop it real early on. she had trouble at first... but i helped her through it. we soon found a common connection, gaming. we both loved it, and had awesome ti ames with it...

it went down hill last month, when i was out of town with classmates at a giant competition. we got in a huge fight because for her prom she wanted to go, but i really did not, but i was going to surprise her later. but one of her friends she was talking to said that her ex(one before me)would love to take her instead, which started the fight.... eventually it led up to her comparing me to the original guy... i lost it, i ""broke up"", but asked for her back cause i knew i over reacted... i promised her i would change... and i tried... i had always had a large ego.... she started talking to the second ex again, and his friend, and that pissed me off beyond belief... so i got in fights with her over it... until i wanted to get over it, i dropped my ego, and talked to to the two guys to settle it... but they were just dicks about it.... 

she has since been ignoring me when i see her, and when i actually talk to her, she talks with spite in her tone.

as of writing all of this, she officially broke it off, and is sorting out what and what not to give back....

my friends go all out with holiday things. lights, decor, gifts, etc. it almost makes it worse. i get physically sick gift giving. i never think i give good gifts. it is so hard to give the right thing to someone. i try so so hard too.  i usually end up spending way more than i can afford. and no one really seems appreciative of it :( i know, you are supposed to just have the ""it is the thoughught that counts"" mindset. but it does not work that way when you are older. 

i used to love decorating. i would make my house look so cute before thanksgiving even hit. i am not religious or anything. i have never celebrated for jesus or whatever. i just loved that ""magic"" that the holidays used to bring. it is just dead now. it does not matter. i mean hell, we do not have any decorations out... i was asking my husband a couple days ago if he wanted to help me put the tree up and he looked at me and said ""why bother?""

have a home built in 1928 (great lakes region), seems like walls were updated to rock lath at some point. had an electrician run a new plug above my fireplace (wife wants to mount a tv, not my preference but oh well). have plaster over brick and then rock lath over the open cavity next to brick. could hire someone to fix but interested in giving this a shot. i see a lot of tutorials on fixing when wood lath and when drywall, but not a lot re here. 

whats the best practice for (a) plaster over brick and (b) patching the rock lath?

for (a) i plan to put the wire behind some sheeting so i am not doing plaster over the wire. i also understand the brick is “thirsty”. what is the best way to treat that and/or seal it before putting the plaster down? 

for (b) - i was guessing i could do two pieces of 2x4 vertically and the screw drywall into thoughse “studs”. i was curious if i should try to do something that mi amics the drywall lath behind this opening thoughugh so it can form keys and lock in? i want to avoid this standing out compared to the rest of the wall as best as possible.

episode 5 of my rampage through vonnegut's bibliography is undoubtedly the one that has made me the most angry so far. make no mistake, i think this book is brilliant, and its ability to elicit such a visceral response from me is a massive credit to vonnegut's comprehension of the human psyche on an individual and societal level.

this book is about howard w. campbell jr, an american-boright now germany-raised man who became a nazi propagandist, who was then recruited by the us army during wwii to secretively deliver messages in code during his broadcasts which served to aid the allied forces throughout the war. this code was inconspicuous enough that absolutely nobody who did not know exactly how to listen for it could have possibly known it was present at all, and the naked ear would only ever hear blatantly unapologetic nazi propaganda.

vonnegut makes it abundantly clear that campbell knew full well the damage of his actions as a propagandist, regardless of the fact that he knew he was also aiding the us against the nazi regi ame he hi amself worked and spread messages for.

this book has made me (what i believe to be) rationally angry towards the entire ""news"" landscape of today, which serves not to inform us as a society but instead to polarize us and divide us. make no mistake, i have already been angry about that for years, but the microscope this novel put over this specific subject matter has just boiled my blood all over again.

i am forcing myself to read at least one book from a different authoughr between each vonnegut read just to ensure i have had enough ti ame for each of his works to sink in, and this is the first ti ame i have felt that i needed the break rather than i ammediately wanting to open up the next one. and that is in every sense a compli ament in this case, because this degree of emotional response is one of the things i absolutely adore about reading. for now, i will be diving into *jane eyre*.

with such a bad score, i do not even feel like continuing my last year of college, finding work, or even doing the stuff i like to do anymore. it is not so much about the test, but more so much about the fact that i have amounted to nothing and have statistical proof that i have amounted to nothing. when the scores came, so many reality checks hit me at once. i have been battling depression for a long ti ame (never was really diagnosed or consulted psychiatrists about it), and i have had periods of bouncing back from it. but i always stuck with this feeling of inferiority around others. these reality checks from my mcat came in full force, further driving the idea of my inferiority into my psyche. 

i have roommates in medical school right now, and when they saw my scores, they did not really do much to help or comfort me. they just told me i can do it again, but i really do not want to. why would i want to put so much effort into failing again? what bothers me is not that i am going to study for it again, what bothers me is that i failed in the first place.

dear reddit, today i will tell you about my beautiful baby brother. he was just 15 when he killed hi amself, hanging hi amself metres away from me. life is so cruel, i do not know where to begin? i just want to let it all out :( i really feel like shit. i guess i will start from the beginning. at age 6 my parents split up, my father being a drug abuser and alcohol addict as well as an emotional and physical leech from myself, my mum and my younger brother by 18 months, jack. 

the three of us moved towns to escape, being so young i did not understand but now i am so greatful and thankful. 
jack did not learight now how to speak until he was 6, thank goodness for speech therapy. he did not cope with change at all and reacted badly towards the schooling system in the new town, due to lack of knowledge and resources mum was forced to quit work and to home school hi am, she did so from year 6-year 10. it was hard on all of us. you cannot understand until you have dealt with it.  

jack and i had no contact at all with our father for ten years, he was in and out of jail etc had a new family whatever. when we 'met' hi am it was a huge eye opener, my mother never badmouthed hi am once and always let us have our own judgement. i made mine quickly when he offered me drugs. mum did not allow us to spend a full weekend with hi am after that.

long story short after a series of minor* unfortunate events (being cheated on, failing school, puberty, self identity, growing up in a single parent family with a disabled brother) i tried to deck myself. i was then diagnosed with major clinical depression and admitted for a few days. long story short, worst moments of my life. (or so i thoughught) (this occured about october 17th 2012)

*i say minor as in comparison to the future they are nothing.

i was put on 150mg zoloft.

moving on i gradually got back into a routine until the 19th of may 2013. the single handedly worst ducking moment of my ducking life my brother hung hi amself. he finished a shift at work (yes he had come that far!!! from being told he would never talk, never finish school to working independently through home schooling and working at a local video rental store!) walked past me and into his room. 

mum just picked hi am up from work, it was about 9pm. they had discussion about jacks laptop and playstation, in which he willingly gave up for positive reinforcement to complete set work. he reassured mum this was the right thing to do with the positive reinforcement, he hired out some movies to watch but in the car on the way home he realised he did not have his laptop or ps3. 

he got home and through mums phone at a window then went into his room and we heard a lot of banging, he was having a meltdown. which was completely normal.

 it was a sunday and i had school tomorrow and mum did not want this to stress me out
so she did something she never did before she rang the police in hopes they could talk to hi am passivly about getting help and that it is okay to be on antidepressants. (he refused to talk to his psychologist or get meds even after open discussion about mum and i both needing meds too.  

soon the banging stopped and mum said ""it sounds like he is self soothing, should i call the police back and tell them not to come?"" i replied ""no, then you can have on paper that you do need some respite help so you can work and support a family, and it would be good to get hi am some help and let hi am know it is okay""

the police arrived and mum politely explained about jack's condition and that they cannot go in there saying ""you cannot do this, you cannot trash the house it is not on."" ""you have to go in there gently and get on his level and tell hi am that everybody needs help someti ames and it is okay and that he is loved and it is okay to have these feelings.""

the first officer went down to jack's room and knocked on the door and politely called his name. no answer. he then opened the door and yelled out call an ambulance. my heart stopped, i looked at mum and just started screaming and crying. 

everything is a bit of a blur around here but i went to the neighbours house who we are very close too and told hi am something happened, he tried to take me back, i rememebr not being able to speak. most of the neighbours came out to see why 5 more police cars had jut arrived at our house and an ambulance. mum was out the front screaming at the neighbour to take me into his place. he did.

from what i have been told, an officer got onto the ambulance as mum could not speak... after what seemed an eteright nowity pat (neighbour) mum and i went to the hospital, we were lead into a room and two doctors walked in, explaining how the heart works and when it stops at a certain ti ame it cannot be restarted. mum but in and said :he is gone is not he?"" they both nodded gravely. i remember screaming at the top of my lungs ""no, my brother no he is mine he cannot be gone my brother he is mine."" and then sobbing. worst freaking night ever. makes my stomach churight now as i type. 

apparently it was a quick death, he used a usb chord and hung hi amself from the fan, there was no jump or anything... the doctors said he would have blacked out in 3 seconds and be brain dead within 10. i do not know but... if i am just being told that to feel better... when i saw hi am he looked peaceful... there was a clean red line around his neck... i held his hands, they were starting to go cold. 

i buried hi am on the same week as my 17th birthday. two days apart. i would do anything in the world to tell hi am i love hi am and have hi am back. please, ask questions, i feel it is healthy to talk about it. 

thanks for listening reddit... there is so much more i have to say but i will not.

i reached out recently, and we started talking again. i told her how i feel and how much i have changed and grown. i apologized deeply and told her i now see what we had and how i would treat her differently. but when i asked about possibly trying again, she told me she is scared i will fall back into old patteright nows and hurt her again. she said she still needs ti ame to heal and asked me not to contact her.

i was a baseball coach once upon a ti ame.  one of the families had a younger daughter, maybe 6 or 7 years old if i had to guess, and she would usually be at practice playing off to the side.  birthday party day at chuck e cheese and she was there.  the brother and sister combo were dropped off.   i am a sucker for their pizza and games, so i stayed.  i am like the only parent that loved that place and i took the kids there quite often when they were younger.  

striving to be the fun coach, i loaded up my card with an unli amited play option.  anyti ame i saw a game finishing up for one of the kids, swipe.  want to play the games that last 5 seconds?  triple swipe.  i made for no game went unplayed.  i saw the sister playing a game by herself, so i hopped on over as it was finishing.  she went to one of the quick games and i told her to play like a maniac.  as she finished, i would swipe.  she was having a blast, i was having fun watching her play.  till her dad came over to get her.  and this dad was not the dad that i knew  confused_face .  he looked at me longer than i liked but said nothing.

i quickly made my way to the party table to show i was not there alone.  the sister was sitting at the table, and had a si amilar little sun dress on and a damn flower hair clip like the other girl.  

thinking back, that is the last ti ame i set for in that place, but only because it would be super weird for me to go there now and grab a pizza.  i do miss that crappy cheese pizza thoughugh.

people always suggest to find hobbies. i play guitar, write music, create digital art, draw, design video games, and write short stories. these are all ok as distractions i guess, but does not really change how i feel about anything.

i have an amazing job. i have worked so hard and for so many years to be here. i have a strong sense of accomplishment about this. but, now that i have proved to myself i can do this - now what?

i know that there are people who have it worse than me. i volunteer and give basic computer training to developmentally disabled children and adults. i like being able to help when i can.. but i do not feel like this is the reason.

for a long ti ame, my biggest motivation was to one day have a wife and kids. i am 32 now and just seem to be having horrible luck with women. i will go on a few dates, and things go well at first, but as they get to know me, they either get bored, or do not like who i am? i do not know what it is exactly, but it does not take them very long for them to move on. when i am dating, i do not act mopey or sad like i might be coming across in this post. they genuinely seem to be having fun when we are together. i know i am not perfect, but i do not think i am a bad person. i feel like the door is closing pretty quickly here for me.

i have no close friends. it is not from a lack of trying, but i find it very difficult to make any kind of meaningful friendships. i have no family left.

so, today, my mom just woke me up, told me to start studying, said i need to find a group of students to understand how to pass this exam, and that i am on a diet now because i just got way too fat (i have got a bad habit to hunt for food out of meals, especially when i am upset, which is often)... then when i tried to leave for my room she told me to come back and not to leave while she is talking, and not to be selfish and care for when other people have a bad day instead of making everything to be about me, when i am actually already beating myself over and over about this exam... when she asked why i act this way and why when she says this to my brother nothing bad happens, the best answer i could give is that he is not as touchy as i am, and she said i should stop being touchy. i tried to divert attention by saying if she comes later, she said yes and understood why i said it (i need the money to pay my therapist) and said not to focus on my stuff for once (ignoring that i do not go to the therapist for fun, i go there because someti ames i am literally two minutes away from thinking jumping out of a window is a good idea) and left with the usual spiel that pretty much means 'go study all day because you are not fucking going to fail this exam again'. and i am seriously wondering if i am really that much of a piece of shit jerk if i cause everything wrong... i am not even sure if i am remembering this correctly or if i am just using an interpretation that favors me and it is really scary.

1113,"i bought a fixer upper a couple years ago. it is not that bad but needs some love. i recently had a tree felled in my backyard in nov and everything froze before i could get to it. now that the weather is warming up, i finally can clean things up. it is a lot for me and i needed help. i am 40 and my old man is... 65? i dunno, 60's. we spent hours working on the tree and were exhausted by the end of the afteright nowoon. we laid around the couch and my dad was just playing on his phone and he slapped his hands on his legs and looked over at me and said, ""get up! we are going. i know what will make us feel better.""

we hopped into my truck and he said he, ""found a place,"" and he would direct me where to go. i thoughught since it was so late, we were going to get some food or a drink. my dad is boujee and he will pay good money for booze and food, so i was not going to object. he had plugged the directions into his phone's gps and was telling me where to go. when we arrived, it was some sorta small asian strip mall, not unsurprising as japanese food is our favorite. we walked up and i started veering left, assumedly to the restaurant and he goes, ""yo,"" and gestures right... to an asian massage parlor, ""my treat.""

interight nowally i started panicking. i do not get massages, i never know what the protocol is and it gets me anxious. my 'tism kicks in and i cannot relax, choosing to focus on odd things like, ""i hope they wash the table, what if some gross person was here last, did they wash their hands, etc."" i become one big knot and rather than say anything when people work on me, i clam up and just let them dig away and muffle my pain in the face rest. plus... i do not know what the clothing rules are, it is always different... if i ever do get a massage, i have to hype myself up mentally for it and i only ever do 30 mins. i am weird, i know.

we walked in and a mama-san came out and my dad told them two for a 1 hour massage. now i am more panicked as i have only ever done 30 mins. we separate to different rooms and the mama-san tells me to get naked and sit. slightly better, as i now know i am supposed to be naked but still anxious as fuck. in walks this attractive asian lady and she makes the room darker and there just red candles and music and incense buright nowing. she tells me to lay down on the table on my stomach and unwrap the towel so it is laying across my butt. she starts her routine and tells me i am a giant knot and to relax. i explained my feelings and she giggled but just nicely ended up talking to me to get me to relax. not conversations but explaining what she was going to do before she did it. 

that ended up being very helpful, as she waright nowed me when she was going to touch me and what to expect. i actually did end up relaxing for once in my life and she could tell. after 30 mins, she told me to roll over onto my back and picked the towel up off me to do so. she told me to just relax and turight now over and ""it was just skin, nothing she has not seen before."" i did not think anything of it and rolled over and she gasped and said, ""oh my! your wife is a lucky lady!""

i was unaware i had a massive erection. i i ammediately panicked and turight nowed into a giant knot again and she covered me slower than i expected but the damage was done. it was hard for me to remain relaxed, except for groin apparently and she sorta kept giggling as she had to go around it or watched it just wave like a metronome at her under the towel, as she shi ammied my thighs and legs around. she apologized for giggling and assured me it was not like at me but the situation. i could not relax and it just made me tense up more, so it felt like a waste of ti ame and money.

we left and i was a bit mortified and told my wife and she nearly peed her pants laughing.

1126,"\[minor spoilers for several of her books. i try to vague in the first paragraph, but the rest of this post has blatant spoilers for beautiful ugly.\]

i have read almost all of alice feeney's novels except for i know who you are. my first was rock paper scissors, which blew my mind with it is twist. i read daisy darker next, which is definitely a standout. it definitely has issues, but it is the only one of her books that is trying to do something different, and the plot twist is not just that we think the narrator in the past is one person but it is actually someone else. someti ames i lie was good, but i saw the big reveal a mile away because i already read rock paper scissors. his & hers and good bad girl get away with these kinds of twists, because the mystery narrators are presented as such. good bad girl had other problems, it was kind of all over the place, but her latest novel is the final straw for me.

so, the flashback chapters always start by disclai aming that abby (the wife) is the narrator, and there are chapters like these where grady is mentioned by name. so, against my better judgement, i decide to trust that this book is not going to have the exact same plot twist that she has in the other novels. come to find out, her godmother is also named abby, and she also has marital issues with her writer husband. so, a few flashback chapters are from abby 1's pov, and most are from abby 2's pov. and it is just like, why can nothing ever be si ample? why does one of the narrators always have to be a surprise?

and this is only one of two massive problems i have with the novel, the other being the reveal of what actually happened to abby 1. okay, so the prologue was from the perspective of grady (abby 1's husband) and it is made very clear that he is home when he gets a call from abby right before her disappearance. come to find out, as soon as he got the call, this man ran a block away, laid underight noweath a woman's coat in the middle of a highway so that she would stop and try to help, and then he threw her off a cliff. but she survived because she held onto a branch like a cartoon.

of all the ways to kill your wife... so, grady is characterized as kinda a douche. he is clearly capable of bad things, but in a 'look the other way' way. this plot is the only instance we get of hi am being particularly violent. the phone call was used as his alibi, but if he is outside would not someone hear the wind or something? 

and thoughse are just my biggest problems. i thoughught the backstory with isle and how all the kids died was really interesting, but it resulting in the creation of an all-woman colony that needs one man to financially support them is pretty outlandish. literally, why do not they just get a female writer??? 

i also despise the way grady is villainized for not having kids. both hi am and abby had shit childhoods so he does not think they would be good parents. that is valid. what is also valid is not wanting kids for literally no reason. abby married hi am knowing he did not want kids. and when he does not change his mind \*surprised pikachu face\*. obviously, he is not innocent, i think he was in denial about how much abby wanted kids, and that was wrong too. and he should not have gotten a vasectomy withoughut telling abby, but also abby should not have gotten ivf withoughut telling hi am. so.",noise,noise data,0.95

i am in my senior year of high school and today as i sat at one of the computers attempting to fulfil a deadline the siren for an emergency announcement came on. naturally, i assumed it was a drill. until i heard that all the seniors were to go to the hall i ammediately.

sitting in that room i joked about the brevity of the situation until we were finally attended to by the vice principal.

he told us with much regret that a student we all knew had died this moright nowing. 

one by one as he was speaking cries of sorrow escaped the mouths of students.

when he stopped speaking the cries became deafening, not because it was loud, but because it was the only thing that remained in that room.

i sat shocked. i did not know the guy personally. in fact, i did not like hi am at all. i disliked hi am for some things he had done to me in the past year. my mind i ammediately went to my friend who was close with hi am.

after however long i eventually found her in the arms of another friend. the sight of her was gut wrenching. i knelt and i ammediately broke down embracing her.

i could not quite wrap my head around what i was feeling at the moment. every ti ame i saw one of my friends heaving in ail or when i embraced someone, i would completely break down as well.

i kept saying that i did not even know hi am. that i did not even like hi am, that i even disliked hi am. that what i was feeling felt selfish, and that i did not have a right to cry. 

after continuously roaming around, hugging and crying, supporting the people around me, i went to one of the school buildings and walked till i saw this teacher i used to really resonate with. she saw me and came out to me where i once again broke down.

i explained how i felt and suddenly realised i was not only crying for the loss of a life, not only for my friends sorrow, but for me too.

seeing the the effect of his death on the people he cared about the most, as well as the people i cared about the most hit me like a stab to the heart.

people who loved hi am, people who were friends with hi am, people who liked hi am, people who disliked hi am, people who only knew of hi am, people who did not even know hi am at all. we were all in deep sorrow.

obviously i am still here and have not shared anything with anyone, but now i cannot face anybody anymore, and have started to leave calls unanswered tonight.  i have had zero contact with anyone in my personal life since i quit my job, outside of declining some plans via text earlier today.  if it has not started already, my friends are probably worried and i do not want them to suffer but i cannot talk to them yet, because i can no longer pretend like everything is ok.  (it is not gotten to the point yet thoughugh where my phone is blowing up)

see my real problem is that i have never really taken responsibility for my actions in this life, i have not really ""integrated"" with my social and emotional self.  it is way beyond introversion; at this moment it is like my mask is off, like i do not even exist in the world, because no one is here with me in my apartment.  i feel next to nothing. i do not think i am evil, but my social behaviors and my mindset are unnacceptable, even if from within they might feel natural to me.  so overall, i feel like i am constantly running a huge lie with my life, maintaining the best exterior appearance i can, in a way since early childhood.

please help me do the right thing.  right now i am on an emotional low, so it is not likely that i will commit suicide.  but it also means that i probably will not call the police, or the hospital, or whoever.  which means that nothing will change, and tomorrow will be like today.  but in 20 minutes, maybe after another unanswered call, my state of mind might be completely different.

part of me wishes that i would just get exposed, that all my thoughughts and secrets would be out there for the world to see and judge.  and why i am so scared of doing that myself, is because i am afraid that i will get to keep my life, but lose all the things that are worth living for in it.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

1161,"before i start i want to make clear that i think the *percy jackson and the olympians* books are really great ya/children's novels. i love them as stories and books, especially for kids, and these books deserve better audiobook narration.

that aside... i have listened to ~200 audiobooks in my life. withoughut a doubt, the percy jackson books have (in my opinion) the worst directed/edited narration of any of thoughse audiobooks. 

many, many lines are read incorrectly... 

* characters are given accents that do not match the text. 

* serious characters are given super-goofy inappropriate voices, like

  * >!luke being one of the main villains but having a surfer dude voice!<, 

  * ghosts haunting percy sound like the old disney giant from jack and the beanstalk who cannot say ""pistachio""... 

  * blackjack is unlistenable, and i will bet money jesse beright nowstein's vocal cords still have not recovered from the injuries sustained while voicing blackjack. 

  * tyson sounds mentally disabled.

  * and more. 

* 10 or 20 sentences per chapter spoken with incorrect emotion, incorrect tone of voice (to the point you have to stop and think what the text actually was trying to say), and/or spoken with emphasis on the incorrect words... and flat-out mispronuciations. 

it is extremely distracting. it is *bad*-bad for a professional production of one of the most popular children's novel series in recent history.

the narration sounds like what i might sound like if someone just randomly turight nowed on a recorder while i was reading percy jackson to my kids.

i am not a perfect reader either. like the actual narrator, i would read some sentences incorrectly just like he does... the difference is that if i were recording a major audiobook release, i would expect my director or editor to listen to what i said so i could re-record thoughse lines that sounded off.

the only two possible conclusions in my mind are either that the audiobook director and editor were completely incompetent, or that the narrator was so bad that they had to give up and make do with the best of a bunch of bad takes... like maybe they knew after 20 bad readings that it was not going to get any better? who knows.

i know this is super harsh but it is also genuinely how i feel in the middle of book 4, i literally cannot believe how bad the narration is on this. again, i have listened to probably about 200 audiobooks.

i think it is on the editor and director (did they have one? they say there was but i do not see much evidence). there was no pride on the production side... this would have been much better if there was better direction and better editing.

avoiding conflict does not make it disappear. it lingers, builds resentment, and creates unnecessary distance. healthy relationships—whether friendships, family, or romantic—are built on grown-up conversations, not avoidance.

if something is bothering you, speak on it. if someone has hurt you, address it. if you have made a mistake, own it. silence is not strength—it is just fear in disguise.

1182,"hello everyone!

welcome to r/history's annual update. if you can cast your minds back to 2024, we had the reddit blackout in june, and it was quite an interesting year all around. fortunately, 2025 looks set to be a peaceful and normal year.

we will be frank: we at r/history understand and acknowledge that 2025 will be a tough year for many. even thoughugh it is only february, it is going to be a politically charged year. we recognise that, and we are all in this together. we all share this small rock flying through space, and we are all affected by global events. so, it feels appropriate to make the following point.

r/history has always had, and always will have…

**the 20-year rule.**

the 20-year rule li amits discussion on r/history to events that happened more than 20 years ago. if you talk about moderight now events, it will be removed. if you post about the current political cli amate in new zealand, it will be removed. if you write a 1,000-word post on why lorde's album *melodrama* is the most influential and i amportant pop album of the past 10 years, you will be correct- but your post will also be removed. we do not allow moderight now politics or soapboxing in any form. if you try to sneak in a comparison between ancient rome and moderight now-day united states, it is the same story. every post on this subreddit needs to be manually approved by a moderator, and we will pick it up.

this also means that your post, even if it is perfectly valid, might not get approved i ammediately. please do not repost it; we will get around to it and will nearly always provide a reason if it is removed. we have noticed reddit is automated filters can be a little zealous, so if you feel your post should have been accepted, feel free to send us a modmail.

here's an interesting fact: on average, we remove about 90% of all submitted posts. we believe this helps us maintain the higher standards of the subreddit.

speaking of higher standards:

**rule 4**: **comments should be on-topic and contribute to the conversation in a meaningful way.**

if you see a post with lots of removed comments, this is usually why. we do not want good, factual answers buried under tropes or memes like you see on other subreddits. no, the 2,500-year-old papyrus did not say, “drink your ovaltine.” if there is a post about finding 10,000-year-old xenomorph eggs in the basement of an aztec temple in the arctic, “you had better not open that!” should not be the top answer.

we generally remove joke comments to help keep conversations focused- so if it seems like you are the first to think of a joke or reference, chances are we have already removed several si amilar comments.

**the weekly question thread and book club thread**

the majority of posts that get removed will be directed to these threads, which refresh every saturday and wednesday- unless there is a more i amportant sticky thread that needs to go up (reddit li amits us to two sticky threads, so we make do). most removed posts are either short questions or book-related queries. these questions belong in these threads.

**the last and most i amportant rule: keep it civil**

it costs nothing to be nice to people. if you cannot help being an outraged jerk, go ahead and click the unsubscribe button- you are welcome to leave. r/history is an inclusive community and welcomes all. any hate speech will be removed, and you you will likely be banned for it. if you see someone spewing hatred, do not engage, just click the report button and a moderator will take care of it. do not engage in shit-throwing, because no one wins, and we are all worse off for it.

that is pretty much it! as usual, if you are interested in becoming a moderator, you can apply via the sidebar. any buright nowing questions, feel free to ask below.

thanks,

no matter how many medications i have tried, therapists i have seen, or ti ames i have been admitted to a psych ward, the outcome is always the same: i am glad to be out of a mental hospital, but just go right back to the same cycle of pain and self-destruction with no motivation to take care of myself. with this pandemic, an enjoyable future for myself seems farther and farther out of my reach. i cannot see my friends; there is nothing fun to look forward to; everything else in life is severely restricted; tensions in my family are high; i cannot afford anymore psych ward visits or other intensive care. most of my day consists of gaming, eating junk food, and +10 hour sleep cycles in which i am blissfully tuned out of reality in lucid dreaming.

1205,"facing the demons for the first ti amei know that human memory is not reliable. we tend to connect multiple of memories into one and fill the gaps of other memories to make the complete story. however - last week monday i went through the memory of severe  physical and verbal punishment my father gave me when i was six years old. i will not get into details that much but i felt like this punishment was never ending. the reason for punishment was my mistake - i left the stove on after boiling water. i was alone home withoughut parents. i was not evil - just wanted to do things by my own. father reacted to it with the most extreme punishment i have ever received from hi am. mother allowed it to happen. and after that i thing things were never the same again. i began to live in fear.

so, last week monday, after nearly 30 years from the incident i cried for the first ti ame and said ""i was just a small boy, i did not fully understand what i did - why did you not show me how to do it properly and see that i can do it too - why did you punish me and scared me for life."" it was relief to cry and through that i remembered several other aspects from my life: the constant control of my father - who can i see, what can i read, what must i study, what sports i must do, what music i can listen, etc. and my constant fear of hi am, fearing when he is going to explode again. and never ever i was allowed to be angry or sad. i began to fear it - i began to fear to show my emotions in front of hi am. jesus christ - as i write this now i feel like vomiting black tar like the river god from spirited away. this is something that i have kept inside all these years and felt that something is wrong withoughut knowing what exactly. i even tried to read [reclai aming your life](http://www.amazon.com/reclai aming-your-life-step-step/dp/0452011698) but did not understand it much since i was not able to connect my childhood life from adult perspective. 

somehow i think that i have never made my own decisions, never listened of what neutralgoodandrew really wants and what that person really is. (see my previous post in /r/depression). my mother was absent during all this. she allowed the abuse and control from my father. she was there, she knew what the father did and allow it to happen. mother - wtf was wrong with you! 

i do not know by i guess submissive people as my mother choose abusive partners. maybe they both carried the mental wounds from their childhood and poisoned the life of me and my sister. 

i grew up as ti amid and scared boy who did not know what to do and where to go. as an adult i felt being completely lost. i do not know whether my depression is connected with this - i strongly believe it is the exact direct cause. i believe that all the control prevented me to build my own identity and own life. i believe that i am on the right track with this and i feel shocked when the memories of verbal abuse and control surface even as i write this.

i feel very mixed now. i feel like i have shaken the grounds of all that i have (or should i say ""my parents"") build myself and i would not mind it all to collapse so that i could start to build things again according to my own rules. thank you for reading this. i think this is one of the most i amportant things i have written in ages. i do not know whom to share it but i guess this is the correct place.

1206,"there is a huge block of ice blocking the drain that drains water from the road. because of this, water has been gathering in a big puddle on the road, and creating a growing pothoughle visible under the water. on the colder days, it freezes and makes the road slippery. people have called the city about this, and nothing gets done. the city workers do not operate in this area. anyways, after slipping on this ice for what seems like the hundredth ti ame during my daily commute, i decided to take matters into my own hands.

when i made it home, i grabbed a snow shovel and started breaking the ice to free the drain. the ice was really stubboright now and i could not see the drain, but i knew that it was there. after a few hours, i decided to call it a day. the next day, i used a saw to saw the ice. still, it did not budge. then i used a pickaxe on the ice. it worked better than the shovel. still, i could not completely break through the metre of ice. i decided to put more road salt on it in a last attempt. after that, i went back inside.

i checked my facebook and there was a post on the community group that said “whoever is the parent of that kid breaking the ice, please get your kid, they are blocking the road.”

where i live, nobody wants to splash a kid with road water, because it is like the bare mini amum of what you can get sued for. so nobody wanted to drive by too fast. they all drove slowly to avoid splashing what they thoughught was somebody's kid. i told the original poster that it was my kid, and asked them to take the picture down. they did take the picture down. i knew i was short, but i did not know that i was that short.

tl;dr: tried to clear ice off a drain near the road, ended up mildly inconveniencing others. someone took my picture and posted it on the local facebook group thinking i was someone's kid.

edit: the block of ice was a “sneckdown”. someone plowed the road and piled the snow onto the drain. it compacted into only a metre.

[deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/04/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-x-2-reteam-vampire-movie-1236365142/):

>*sinners* marks another strong reason why ryan coogler is at the top of his generation of filmmakers, and jordan continues to show why he is a real deal movie star.

[hollywood reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/sinners-review-michael-b-jordan-ryan-coogler-horror-1236186742/) (90):

>the movie is smart horror, even poetic at ti ames, with much to say about race and spiritual freedom. it is not in the jordan peele league in terms of welding social commentary to bone-chilling fear. but *sinners* is a unique experience, unlike anything either the director or jordan has done before.

[slashfilm](https://www.slashfilm.com/1831292/sinners-ryan-coogler-movie-review/) (9/10):

>""sinners"" is several things at once — a monster movie, a blood-soaked action film, a sexy and sensual thriller, and a one-location horror flick as intense and paranoia-driven as anything from the original ""assault on precinct 13"" or quentin tarantino's filmography – but its greatest strength comes from how well coogler blends every big idea on his mind.

[the wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-review-ryan-coogler-michael-b-jordan-vampire-horror/) (88):

>“sinners” is a bloody, brilliant motion picture. ryan coogler finds within the vampire genre an ethereal thematic throughline; and within the music genre a disturbing, tempting monster. stunningly photographed, engrossing cinema — epic to the point where it seemingly never ends, which is undeniably indulgent, but no great sin. this is a film about indulgence, the power indulgence wields and the dangers indulgence invites into our lives. it is a sweaty, intoxicating, all-nighter of a movie, and its allure cannot be denied.

[the independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/sinners-movie-2025-michael-b-jordan-cast-ryan-coogler-b2730833.html) (4/5):

>if cinema were not in such a sickly state, *sinners*'s electric fusion of genres – historical epic, horror, and squelchy actioner – would be a guaranteed box office sensation. instead, the film arrives with an uneasy sense that this is some kind of final stand for original ideas. one can only hope audiences recognise its bounty of riches.

[the guardian](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/sinners/) (3/5):

>for many, the movie could as well do withoughut the superight nowatural element, and i admit i am one of them; i would prefer to see a real story with real jeopardy work itself out. but there is energy and comic-book brashness

vanity fair (80):

> sinners is propulsive and stirring entertainment, messy but always compelling. the film's fascinating array of genres and tropes and ideas swirls together in a way that is, i suppose, singularly american.

i am 18/m and i am a senior in highschool. i had a pretty rough break up with a girl about nine months ago. i am the one who broke up with her. i realize that staying with her would cause a world of problems years down the road. her family is psychotic and her brother and i do not get along. that is beside the point that is not why i am posting this.

i honestly think i have been going crazy lately. she told me over the summer that her new boyfriend was so much better than me and that i did nothing for her. i have been grappling with this ever since she said it to me. people always say that words cannot hurt you but i think after she said that i was in the most pain i have ever felt. 

i feel worthless. i am 5'4 and i am 18 so the odds of me finding another girl are pretty sli am. after i graduate i plan to go to college and i like to meet another girl but i am worried my height is going to become a serious problem. i am so stressed out about this i cannot even breathe. there are some nights where i wake up and have chest pains and shortness of breath. it scares me to think that i will never meet someone who will actually care about me and not pretend to like the last one. she met the new kid a week after we broke up and often talked about hi am while we dated. 

i do not want to end up like all the early 20s people on 4chan complaining about their lives and how they cannot get a woman. i do not know if i have ever really considered suicide but i am worried that if i keep thinking like this it may end up that way down the road. that girl really messed with my head and now i feel completely worthless. i know i am a good person and i try to do the right thing. i often wonder if this is karma or somehow the universe is taking its revenge on me. does anyone have any advice?",SuicideWatch,depression,0.90

later i got to watch a friend i hadnt really talked to in a while and it was nice but i still couldnt shake the sense of unbelongingness/whatever word (other people were there with her being all banter-y, like normal social humans aka not me) and i think it woul be pretty accurate to just say that i am really lonely

my home life has sucked beyond repair. it has gotten to the point where i asked the boyfriend to leave. he refused even thoughugh he never signed the lease with the landlord and my name is on all the utilities. he just got back from deployment and promised me he would start looking for jobs in january after taking the holidays off, which was no biggie to me. january, february, march, and april have all passed with hi am not even trying to find a job. his truck broke down from disuse in that ti ame as well. i am/was the grocery shopper, the cleaner, took care of the cat, cooked, and did the laundry. all the while he was playing video games for 48 hours at a ti ame. i ask for normal relationship things in returight now with no effort on his part.

we have fought so much about hi am being a better partner and doing and sharing in some of the the things i like. he changes for a day and then it is back to square one. we have a dead bedroom. after being on deployment you had think he would have pent up sexual needs? no, in the six months he is been back, we have only had about 5 sexual encounters. right now it is been once since mid december. i know that is partially my fault because i do not initiate, but i admit my self confidence is in the tubes and when i did try to initiate, he wanted to play video games instead. 

home life is not all of it, my social group has moved away and i feel like i have zero people to talk to. all i have is my sister, and granted she does not want to hear about my dead bedroom. i would love to go out and meet new people and go on adventures, but the bf abhors public places. we have been out once since january.

then there is generic work crap. usually i can handle it, but this past week has been so overwhelming that i am crying at work and when i get home. i miss being artistic, i was trained in theatrical stage management but cannot make a living off of it in a medium midwest city, and hate the idea of moving to chicago or new york to work three jobs to make ends meet.

so i just feel at the absolute end of my rope. i called off work today because i could not handle another day of soul sucking stress.

i just want someone who loves me deeply and wants to go on adventures with me. instead i am spending my evening with a mixed handful of drugs and wine. i just keep thinking about adding more. i do not even want this to be a cry form help because i do not want to spend the money on yet another hospitalization. i just want to know i am being heard. all i have done this past week is fantasize about offing myself. and i know the overdose option is very painful from experience. i want out. after over a decade of returight nowing to this same spot, i am lacking the faith that things do get better.

i just can not feel the ends of it. there is this strange, nameless sadness that eats me up from the inside out. it is corrosive; it rusts me to the core.

i cannot feel the ends of it; it starts at the coright nowers of my mind, and it begins to bleed into my psyche, and then into my heart. i feel a loss that i cannot even name. i feel a world flooding around me, and it is so fast, and it so so full of life and it is so full of joy and beauty

i am afraid of the people around me because i am afraid that they are blind. i am afraid of the police, i am afraid of the media, i am afraid of the weather, i am afraid of my body, i am afraid of my mind, and i am afraid of this revolting, vile, churight nowing abyss that looks like my future. i am desperately afraid of the life that i will lead with this loathsome plague in my mind. i see tragedy and loss and bereavement and inconsolable despair.

i just cannot find a name. i cannot find one single mother fucking adjective to utilize to explain this desperation. i cannot say the words that will connote the depth of this hopelessness. there is a world churight nowing around me, and i am stagnating in this endless terror.

it is gotten so bad at one point that the daeva behaviour caused a war. the daeva send dara to murder, torture and bury alive a whole city. the books describe how he killed babies, castrated children and buried people alive or flailed them to death.

i have just reached the part we are muntadihr told nahri that she and dara caused jamshids wounds and ...she is outraged and the other daeva tells her she is rightfully outraged because they are daeva and the others just sandflies and how dare they.

is the book actually trying to sell me fascists as the hero's? will there be anything revealed in the coming story that somehow makes the daeva story out to be a lie?

i wonder if it is because i am older that i do not grasp the young characters but the book seems to tell me that the one character that wants fairight nowess for all is a religious zealot.

i do not understand why i am told the nazis of this books society are actually the hero's but then the book is slow to reveal all the back story.

can someone spoil the daeva story to me?

thanks because i am really baffled how character growth is supposed to erase the celebration of fascists in this book",noise,noise data,0.95
1240,"so this actually happened yesterday evening, but before the fuck up is explained, i need to provide the back story 

basically, i matched with a girl on a dating app a few weeks ago and we got on really well, and slowly but surely the conversation got a bit more flirty and then it started turight nowing sexual, and by the ti ame we agreed to meet up for a date, it seemed to be a case that sex was a strong possibility if everything went well during the date

the date was planned for yesterday evening and when i saw her in the distance with her back turight nowed to me waiting at the agreed upon meeting point, in the clothes she told me she was going to wear (we told each other what we were going to be wearing for the one who saw the other first) i thoughught i would try to make a good first i ampression. during our conversations over messages, she told me that she liked guys who were assertive and took control, so bearing that in mind, i went over and i slapped her bum to say hi (it was dumb, i know, but i thoughught she would like it)

and then she turight nowed around, and my fuck up was discovered because it was not my date. it was a completely different woman! her shock turight nowed to anger and my confused face was turight nowed into a pained face when she punched me in the face 

she was shouting for a guy who came running out who i presume was her boyfriend/brother etc who wanted to fight me but i was trying and failing to explain that it was the wrong girl and during this commotion my date came out from being inside and made light of the situation by confirming she was the intended target of my bum slap

i learight nowt a valuable lesson that day, which i never should have had to learight now in the first place, but it all worked out in the end. my date found the funny side of it, and girl who had her bum slapped and the guy with her begrudgingly accepted my apology.

tldr - i slapped a girls bum thinking it was my date's but it was not her

tifu by accidentally ruining the walls in my bathroom because of two bees, and now i gotta repaint them.

i was just shitting normally when i suddenly heard two buzzes at the window. i saw two bees half stuck there; i do not know how they got in. i laughed at them, but then one of them got out. i i ammediately zipped up my pants and ran out of the bathroom because i am allergic (not deadly) to bee stings.

i felt extra brave today, so i went to look for something to kill it with, but i found nothing except a random spray. i grabbed the spray in one hand and a sick-smelling spray in the other because i thoughught it would keep them away from me. i turight nowed on the lights and opened the doors, and saw both bees on the floor, but they were kinda far away. i did not want to get close, so i decided to snipe them from a distance.

i missed, so i just sprinted to the door and turight nowed off the lights again. at this point, it had been five minutes, and i really needed to wipe, so i decided to risk it. i went back into the room fully prepared and just sprayed them for like three minutes straight. i kept missing until they made a blunder and got into my previous missed shots, and both died.

to my horror, the walls changed color, and now i have to repaint them, which really sucks because they were in good shape.

1256,"dear mildlyinterested reader,

we want to extend our heartfelt gratitude for your patience and unwavering support during the recent turbulence in our community. our subreddit is a labour of love, and we have weathered this storm together.

recent events have been confusing for all of us, from the vote, sudden removal of moderators, to conflicting messages from reddit. as your mod team, we feel it is essential to clarify the situation.

on june 19, [the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes](https://redd.it/14dmkw1). however, before i amplementing these changes, reddit took sweeping actions, removing all 27 moderator accounts withoughut waright nowing. this left us baffled and conceright nowed.

here's a brief ti ameline of the events:

1. on june 19, the poll results favoured partially reopening with changes. we announced the vote results and planned changes to the sub, including marking it as nsfw due to the common posts of phallic objects (no explicit content allowed). [click here to view that announcement which has been approved and locked for posterity](https://redd.it/14eox9x).

2. a tug-of-war between the u/moderatorcodeofconduct account and the remaining moderators ensued, with the post repeatedly being removed and reinstated. each mod involved was i ammediately locked out of reddit. subreddit settings were also unilaterally changed by the admin account.

3. eventually, all moderators were removed and suspended for 7 days, with the vote results deleted and the community set to “archived.” 

4. a lot of public outrage ensued, with details posted on r/modcoord about what happened. at that point, no other subreddit had been targeted yet, leaving the situation uniquely unclear.

5. admin cited actions as an ""error"" and promised to work with us to solve the situation. for /r/mildlyinteresting posterity, this will henceforth be referred to as the mistake trade_mark .

6. all our accounts were unsuspended and reinstated, but only with very li amited permissions (modmail access only). for what it is worth, 'ti ame moderated' for every moderator was reset (e.g. /u/redsquaree moderated since 11 years ago, reset: currently showing moderated since ""1 day ago"").

7. the awaited discussion never happened. instead, the admins presented us with an ulti amatum: reopen the subreddit and do not mark it as nsfw, or face potential removal again. the inconsistent and arbitrary application of reddit is policies reveals a possible conflict of interest in maxi amizing ad revenue at the risk of user safety and community integrity.

8. finally, our moderation permissions were restored after we ""promised"" to comply with their conditions, but we kept the subreddit restricted while we ponder our next steps..

problems remain unresolved, and reddit is approach to policies and communication have been troubling. we believe open communication and partnership between reddit and its moderators are crucial for the platform's success.

as a team, we remain dedicated to protesting reddit is careless policy changes. removing ourselves or vandalizing the subreddit will not achieve our goals, but rather hinder our community. we are here to ensure r/mildlyinteresting is not left unattended.

we call for the establishment of clear, structured, and reliable communication channels between reddit admins and moderation teams. teams should be informed and consulted on decisions affecting their communities to maintain trust and integrity on the platform. we shared this request with the admin who promised to work with us, so far they have ignored it. 

us mods are still deciding how exactly to reopen, not that we have been given much choice.

sincerely,

the r/mildlyinteresting mods",noise,noise data,0.95

i am struggling with myself. there are things about myself which rationally i know i need to accept and be at peace with, but i am struggling to and its making me unhappy. 

the first is my physical appearance. i have all of these ideals about how appearance does not matter, and what matters should be ""the content of your character."" but i am objectively unattractive. my eyes are different colors, i am losing my hair, i am a little overweight... i could go on. i am constantly aware of these things and it makes being confident around people hard, and makes being confident around women, especially, hard. 

the second thing is that i have this weird sense of humor. i find some random things amusing that most other people do not. it means i someti ames put my foot in my mouth. in fact i feel like whenever i open my mouth, i am going to say the wrong thing. this does not help with the confidence thing, and makes social interaction hard. 

all of this has meant that i have become quite isolated over the past year or two, and suffer a great deal from loneliness. i guess my question is how do you accept your flaws? how do you accept things that you cannot change about yourself (like your appearance)? if i did not hate these things about myself, or did not care that i had these flaws, then i would be less bothered by being lonely, and maybe could be happy?

afaik, temp and salinity are not constant within a layer, and they smoothly and slowly vary with depth. then, you get an extremely small buffer zone where temperature &/or salinity change rapidly, and then you enter a new layer. 

but like, why? i get that oil will sit on top of water due to its lower density, and i get why oil is attracted to oil and water is attracted to water and why they are not attracted to eachother, and how that means that they wont mix. but i do not understand why salt water and slightly saltier water will not mix, i do not get why the salt does not diffuse in such a way that it smoothly varies with depth. also, i get why it is colder deeper in the ocean (with some exceptions, like near the poles, and near the ocean floor someti ames), but i do not understand why temperature changes like a step function instead of something differentiable.

i cannot stand the thoughught that he is breaking down like this overseas and it kills me to see hi am like this. i have reassured hi am its okay to cry, its normal to break down, its fine, ""i am so sorrys"" and sending hi am pictures of my friends dog (who he loves). after tonight thoughugh, i tried a different approach. i told hi am to create his own miracle, to dig down within hi am self and put on a shield to avoid being hurt by these people. to spend the ti ame that he is crying and shutting down differently, and exert his energy towards getting shit done that needs to be done and gtfoing from that place and thoughse people. i tried the tough, motivation-geared approach and i hope this way helps.

to be honest, seeing hi am like this scares me to death. i do not want his health to fail from all this stress and pressure, i do not want hi am to completely lose his sanity and hi amself in this, i do not want hi am to be reeling in pain. i told hi am to hold it all in and then grieve when hes back here, with people that care and love hi am. i do not know if he can do it thoughugh... the look on his face tonight was one i have never seen before, and it turight nowed my stomach inside out. i felt sick. i have never seen hi am look so...so...destroyed. it scares me.

i do not know what to do. its all i think about... at home, at work, driving... its affecting my performance at work and my numbers have dropped drastically (in sales). my boss is worried about me. my family and coworkers are conceright nowed. but its like, when someone you love is being destroyed and they are so far away, i cannot concentrate on anything except the aching in my heart. 

i do not know what to do, how to help. i feel awful for hi am...

1293,"tw self harm. aita for asking my boyfriend to go to bed earlier because i am having a hard ti ame dealing with hi am self harming?so my boyfriend (18) and i (19... dunno if it matters thoughugh.) both have severe anxiety and depression. our relationship is great and weve been together for two years. 

recently my boyfriend has started taking anti depressants/anti anxiety meds and it has been really fucking with hi am. hes been trialing new meds every month or so for about three or four months. there havent been any good results so far and within the last week and a half hes started to cut hi amself. i have been losing my mind about this and trying not to make it obvious since most of his issues stem from feeling like other peoples negative feelings are a result of his actions even if it doesnt always make sense. hes incredibly hard on hi amself and clearly we are only just starting to realize the extent of it.

i havent stopped crying. today i went to the doctors for a check up and she said i am a hot mess to my face (no hard feelings. shes right) and is putting me on anti depressants. its been a hard day. ive never wanted to take them and for about 2 years ive declined the opportunities ive had to take them but i just cannot cope with this. i have had friends who had some severe self harm issues and saw themselves out of it with ti ame and help so ive been here before and ive been doing everything i can but i see it getting worse every day and it just fucking breaks me. i cant just compartmentalize and be a support beam for hi am like i can for my friends. its so hard to see someone who is so precious to me hurting like this and i cant keep it inside. he can never know the scale of it. i am worried it would make his self hatred a lot worse.


he plays video games with his friends as a hobby and often ti ames he will play games with them, they hop off to go to bed etc, and then hes left alone with his thoughughts and no one to talk to because at this point its 5 am and no one is alive at 5 am in our friend group. i worry about hi am not having anyone to talk to. when i am talking to hi am i feel all this pressure lifted off of me because i know hes safe and okay. i wouldnt ever force hi am to talk to me or obsessively catalogue where he is or demand to hear everything about everything cause what the fuck thats awful. ive just noticed this overwhelming feeling of relief. we do not hang out for very long periods of ti ame consecutively usually. he might stay for the night and if i do not have the chance to see hi am some other day i might swing by his place to say good night but weve been doing that since we got together. 


anyway, i asked hi am if he could do me the very odd favor of going to bed around 11pm-1am for me. i mentioned that if he felt that was a little too weird or like overbearing that i would understand if he didnt. he said he would and doesnt seem to have an issue with it but i cant help but wonder if i am being overbearing. 




additional info: he has a therapist and has been recommended to see a psychiatrist by his doctor. its all very recent thoughugh so he hasnt started the process of seeing anyone new yet. he has told friends and has a support system but someti ames that isnt enough until you can learight now to respect and love yourself",SuicideWatch,depression,0.75

1295,"i am creating a historical game set in xviith century france in a monument called port-royal-des-champs. it is part of a research project on heritage promotion (i am at the chcsc lab of the university of versailles).

the abbess garden story is a mix of history and fiction. it begins in 1643 and occurs in the abbey of port-royal-des-champs in france. this abbey is now a [national museum](https://www.port-royal-des-champs.eu/). the main plot revolves around the legacy of a deceased and very real british spy, [john cecil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/john_cecil_(priest)), who died in paris in 1626.  
  
nathalie genet-rouffiac is the director and curator of the port-royal-des-champs, but she is also a historian specialising in spies. before joining the museum, she did her phd on the british islands in the 17th century and worked on english and irish nationals in france who were often forced to become spies. she then worked as the head of archives for the wwii spies in france.   
  
i asked her for an interview on real spies of the 17th century. for about 1 hour, we discussed british spies and their relation to this place, gardening history, religious views of the ti ame, etc. you can watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4phsut4x6xq](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4phsut4x6xq)

1311,"bought and listened to the audiobook. it is worth mentioning that the audiobook version contains podcast discussions. so, there might be some differences.

i should preface this by saying that i normally do not read anything motivational or guru books, but i wanted to give it a try because i am trying to lose some weight, and i thoughught it would not hurt to listen.

the beginning, as with most motivational books, is a bit boring, but i am very glad it did not take long for the book to actually start. honestly, i do not need all the promises for a great and inspirational tale. let me decide that for myself, goggins.

the story/memoir actually begins with goggins' childhood. lots of abuse, discri amination and some learight nowing disabilities due to lingering trauma. gotta say, this part was hard to stomach. i cannot stand depictions of child abuse.

fortunately, goggins, his mother, and a reluctant brother are able to get away from that. and while it does not solve all the problems, i am glad it stops the main threat of physical abuse.

the next few years in goggins' life are full of challenges. at school, at home, on the streets, and they carry on till he decides to join the navy seals.

goggins, however, spends little to no ti ame talking about the relationships with his, then, wife or child. gotta say, i did not like how they are so casually brought up only to be i ammediately cast aside like they are inconsequential. why even bring them up then? he is also very nonchalant about his many divorces; to the point that he spends a single sentence to cover the topic. like i said, if you are ashamed or si amply consider all of that to be irrelevant, why even include it?

i will say, thoughugh, his jouright nowey to losing 100 pounds in 3 months and studying for the entrance exam to the navy was, as expected, very inspirational.

wanna turight now your life around? you can do it very quickly. just gotta develop an obssession with exercise and train for 3 months like there is no tomorrow (i am not being sarcastic, cynical, or skeptical). it really is that si ample (according to goggins).

and while i did not go as crazy as hi am with the gym, i gotta say it did help me commit to not skipping training sessions. good job book!

that said, goggins' experiences in the military are full of pain that seemed unusually abnormal. it would later become clear that he had both a hole in his heart, for which he underwent 2 surgeries much later in the book, and poor stretching practices; that is, none at all. and not just that, a chronic history of underpreparedness.

tbf, it is both commendable as it is laughable that he went through life withoughut stretching. i mean, why? how is that possible? i do wonder if this is a common thing for some people. all trainers i have met, even teachers at school, give students/clients a stretching routine. so, how did this happen?

despite that, and i was not trying to understate any of his accomplishments, goggins really stood out wherever he went due to his devotion to training. i mean, the guy used to run on fractured legs. who does that? certainly not me. not worth it.

however, he also mentioned the mistakes he made by isolating hi amself. because he did not strengthen the relationships with his teammates, he lost many opportunities he really wanted. a valuable lesson learight nowed: there is no 'i' in ""team.""

all in all, i think a marathoughner he met during a (califoright nowia?) race summed it all up really well. we are all idiots trying our best. if i had to name his book, that would be the perfect title. and goggins really had to go the extra mile because of it.

do i recommend this book? yes, that is, if you are looking for extra motivation. and i am saying this si amply because it helped me get motivated when i needed it. however, it is no masterpiece.

will i be reading more of goggins? no. i do not think there is any point to it. however, for me at least, it was worth a single read to learight now why one should not approach challenges unprepared.",noise,noise data,0.90
1312,"i travel across the us with some frequency, and on one particular occasion, funds were tight, so i  choose a trip with multiple stops & a plane change in order to save some money. of course, there were delays and missed flights... at the end of it all, i had been traveling for over 14 hours and i was exhausted. 

i live in a major metropolitan area, so taking public transit back from the airport is my usual means of getting home. in this case, i got back so late that i literally caught the last bus running on my route for the night. i was practically slipping in and out of consciousness when the bus got to my stop. i hopped off, grabbed my suitcase and started to cross the street when i realized i had left my $1,500 cpap on the bus! 

by the ti ame i realized what had happened, the bus was already over a block away. the bus was going towards a less desirable part of the city, so i was sure it was gone forever. i tried calling the bus dispatch center but it was way past business hours and all i could do was leave a message on their lost-and-found answering service. 

i sat there at the bus stop in stunned silence. 

i could not afford a replacement. i was freaking out about what might happen if i had to sleep for weeks withoughut a cpap until i could get it replaced. i looked up, saw a church across the street and thoughught to myself, ""at this point, it could not hurt""  grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes  crying_face  so i just asked whatever entity or i amaginary sky-finger that might be out there to help a weary traveler out. 

i sat there for a while longer, trying to call non-emergency police dispatch, the bus station terminal, googling my options for a cheap replacement machine, etc. 

suddenly, off in the distance i see a bus coming back from the opposite direction. i flagged them down and asked the driver if they found anything, but it was the wrong bus. she got on the radio and asked the other bus drivers still out there if they found anything and one of them said yes & that they were on their way back! 

i could not believe that it survived and that she was actually kind enough to answer the other operator. (she later told me that they are not allowed to returight now things to people after they have excited the bus. they are supposed to go to lost & found at the depot, if you can believe it. company policy or whatever. lol) 

tl;dr - left my $1500 cpap on the last city bus on my route for the night. totally lucked out thanks to another bus driver, and got it back somehow. ",noise,noise data,0.90

so why do you still question yourself when life hits you again?



was it easy back then? no.did you have all the answers? not even close.

but you still showed up, still pushed through, still found a way.



that is what mental strength really is

it is not loud, it is not pretty.



it is quiet, steady, rough and it remembers.



you have been through painbefore, you have sat in the storm and refused to back down, so when the next challenge shows up,you do not need to panic you just need to remember you have made it before.



every obstacle is a chance to build that muscle again, not to escape from it, not to avoid it.

just take the next step.



growth lives in resistance, progress lives in discomfort and strength is earight nowed when nobody's clapping for you.



remember that you do not rise to the level of your goals or to the level of your[ ](http://habits.so)dreams.



while you doubt yourself,check your actions.

are you still showing up?are you still doing the work?



discipline is not loud, it is quiet, boring, repetitive.



but it wins.



you have already done the i ampossible, you just forgot about it

bought the home in the fall and had heavy rains that did have some leaks in a couple spots. nothing crazy but one area was where the sewage line was so i got a professional waterproofing company to install a gutter system, sump pump (did not have one before,) and this vapor barrier on the walls. 

i wanted to get second opinions on flooring for this space. my plan was to get some sort of dricore subfloor to put down for the whole rectangular space (~ 48' x 28') 

my reasoning for getting the tricore subfloor (or si amilar)
1. obviously in case the gutter system has an area that fails the water and air has a space to travel underight noweath
2. to help insulate the floor
3. peace of mind knowing there is a system that'll help mitigate cost if there is a flood/water leaks 

am i overthinking this?

1365,"am i depressed?okay, here's the backstory:  i am 27 years old and in a bad position.  i have always enjoyed spending ti ame to myself and working on my personal projects (i draw and work on comics).  i recently moved back home after not being able to bounce back financially after a pretty bad circumstance, so i decided to returight now to school and get my degree in computer science with a concentration in computer graphics and effects.

lately, alot of my friends seem to get upset at me when i do not want to hang out or if i seem aloof or quiet.  if i try and talk to them about school, which at the moment is the foremost of my focus, they usually do not have much to say or switch the subject.  these are people i knew growing up and have moved on with their lives, but i am trying to move forward to what i truly want to do. but it seems like everyone trashes me for not 'being fun enough' or not 'being excited or exciting.'  

i enjoy studying compsci because it is new and engaging, giving me a different way of think and i do not want to walk out with just a paper, i want to get a career.  the only thing is, someti ames i feel as thoughugh i am hurting the people around me when i decide to study or spend my ti ame developing.  everyone has moved on and has had kids, i on the other hand, do not have a child nor money.  

my best friend said something to me the other day while we were joking around (i assumed joking around) and he end up saying 'that is why no one wants to hang out with you.'  this created a vortex of thoughught in my mind, having me circle around as to why people seem to be upset with me or do not like me, just really depressing stuff.  i have been feeling this way for a while, ever since moving back home.  i focus on studying, on writing and drawing, wanting to develop something great and taking care of what is in front of me.  my question reddit, am i truly depressed?  am i overthinking my situation and causing further depression? by studying and trying to truly understand my school work and be a better computer scientist really making me a 'boring, unlovable person?'

1371,"i feel like i am getting worse every day (long post)...three months ago, i was a normal college student and now i am a broken shell of who i once was. i was doing fine until i started having trouble in my english class which was not good since i was an english major. eventually my grade got so bad that it brought everything else out of my head and one night at 12:30 am, i walked from my dorm room to the nearest er and checked myself in because i was suicidal. from there, i spent the next six days in a local mental hospital and after a brief release, went back for another 3 before staying out ever sense.

after my release and bipolar diagnosis, i dropped out of school and began wading through a series of appointments, medication changes, an i ampulsive moment where i ran away from home on a greyhound bus and meetings with social groups because of my autism diagnosis from back in school. all that has happened is that my sense of purpose has been eli aminated, and any hope of going back to my previous life is gone.

my life has changed so much that i will never completely recover. since i dropped out of college and my bad grade was in the same subject i was majoring in, then clearly i am not meant to be a college graduate. because of my lack of a degree, the only chance i have of any life above the poverty line is if i can get into my state's vocational rehabilitation program. even that will not get me too far. the involuntary hospitalization will stay on my record forever and i will always have these issues to deal with.

the point i am trying to make is that any hope of a normal life is fading fast and at best i will be a menial worker struggling to live over the poverty line while struggling with my interight nowal problems. at worst, i will end up as a shut-in/welfare leech like christian weston chandler where my entire existence is to fail at everything i try and make an ass of myself while doing it. i am even starting to look like hi am since my medicine slows my metabolism and i gained 10 pounds in a month. i am not suicidal yet but offing myself seems like a superior alteright nowative.

1372,"(19m)screw the life i am living right now. i am moving to japan and starting over.i do not like myself, i bet that is pretty common around here and you all will understand why. 

i hate myself for the normal reasons lots of guys around my age, especially on reddit. i am exactly what you would expect the stereotypical person on reddit to be like. i am just a loser who is addicted to the interight nowet. i spend hours and hours on the interight nowet doing nothing at all, just losing ti ame i could be spending doing other things. i used to be addicted to it, my grades kept getting lower and lower because i constantly chose the interight nowet over anything else. of course, i am looking to become a computer programmer, and currently studying cs at college, just like everyone else in my position. 

i hate computers. i feel like a slave to them. ever since i was in middle school all i did every day was use a computer. i became dependent on it to entertain myself and never grew any actual friendships. and yet i need them. the best possible lifepath for my future involves computers. i cannot just cut them out of my life because i am dependent on them. i need them, but using them hurts me.

i became a narcissist and lied to myself about not needing other people, and thus i needed the computer more. for a long while i was in this cycle where i would not have friendships because i was a narcissistic asshole, and justify not having friendships through my narcissism. i got out of it fortunately, but it has had irreparable damage on my life. i could not make more friendships in high school because i never knew how to, and since a lot of ways people meet people are through other people and i never had a core group of people in the first place, i could not make friends that way. i was a social reject all the way through high school. 

and now i am in college, still a social reject. i had to take all night classes my first semester because there is a special program at my college for students who were borderline accepted. i could not join clubs or anything like that since my classes started at thoughse ti ames. i was in an apartment and only met 5 other people, unlike dorm people. 3 of my roommates are addicted to league and thus they never do stuff and i cannot do anything with them. one is foreign exchange who is constantly studying and looks does not go do stuff either. the last one is always doing stuff and only comes into the apartment to sleep. i did not ever make a friend group with them. it sucks that through random chance he most critical period when people make friends in college, i could make none.

but i had hope for next semester. i have no night classes anymore, so i can go do stuff! so amazing right? i planned on joining ulti amate frisbee to get to know people and joining two or three clubs to make sure i meet people. well i do not think that will really get to the heart of the issue.

the real problem is that i have never once had a good romantic interaction with women all my life. not even once. every single ti ame i have tried only bad things came out of it. in middle school i asked out some chick. we went on like one date and only talked to each other online afterwords. we were ""together"", but i was too much of a loser to do anything with her. eventually we just stopped talking online. skip forwards to high school and pretty much the same thing happens again with a different girl, except this one is more fucked up. we actually did things together. we never kissed or anything like that cuz i was too much of a pussy. the majority of my interactions with #2 were still online, althoughugh we did go on dates about twice every week. my relationship with #2 was messed up because we both emotionally manipulated each other through lying and deceit. i i amplied i wanted to break up so she lied about having cancer, since she was depressed, i told her if she killed herself i could too because i ""loved"" her. it was terrible and we were both more depressed because of it. that relationship was the worst one of all. then she moved north and we had to break up because of the distance. then #3 comes along and basically begins to do some minor flirting with me. she is completely not my type, i think she looked kind of ugly and had no chemistry whatsoever. *but she pursued interest in me all herself.* no one had ever done that before. i always started the relationship and the women had did not seem to have interest in me beforehand. i did not care that i did not like her, her liking me felt good enough. so i flirted back, asked her out and started a real, proper relationship. i actually kissed her, and had sex with her. but i never liked her. i thoughught i would grow to like her, but i never did. eventually she grew strong emotions for me, and i only wanted sex from her. i did not even realize it at first, but i slowly began to manipulate her for it. i broke up since college was coming soon, and now she hates me more than any of her other exes.

my first post on this sub, and i will make it short if anyone actually gives a fuck. i am pretty hopeless but i know i have potential.. i think about offing myself pretty often, and have recently gotten the urge to cut. never did, except a few ti ames 2 years ago. but besides that i am going to try to make this short.

i am a 23 year old male. i turight nowed into a junkie after my baby mom left me. i loved her and wanted nothing more in life to have a son and kill myself to have my legacy carry on. that is what i told myself in school when i was younger. lost that thoughught when i got my girlfriend pregnant but i am pretty sure it was still there, probably subconsciously. selfish, i know. i am a selfish piece of shit. she cheated on me, broke my heart, i formed a pill addiction and it led to heroin when she fucked a close friend i grew up with after his baby mom just passed 2 weeks after giving birth and being in a coma, and bm was supposedly her ""bestfriend"". she also took both of my cars, 05 chrysler 300 on 22s, paid 8k for it, and my 09 chevy i ampala. paid 4200 cash for my baby. betrayed my trust and said she would never take my cars. since she left, i think december of 2017? i have been homeless, cannot hold a job, never actually could. used to sell drugs, was fucking great at it, and it brought me i ammense joy being the fucking weed man. i am now also on child support. i have no motivation to get my shit together, to be a father, to excel in life, to wake up in the moright nowing etc. i missed an interview yesterday because i did not want to get up. only ti ames i am happy is when i am on dope, and only when i am making money to buy it. it has become my only motivation to wake up. i am tired of the lifestyle, i am tired of wanting to fucking die. i am tired of not being able to go home. i want to live with my mother but she does not give enough of a fuck to move out of the trailer park i got kicked out of. the old manager told the new owners that i said some shit to her young daughter. i am not a disgusting fucking pedophile, and i never said a fucking thing to that child besides hi. now i cannot go visit my mother at her own house and i would like to know why someone would say something like that about me? other people have heard, and i never knew until recently. now i people in my town probably think i am a potential fucking pedophile. i cannot even fucking tell people because who wants to fucking hear that? i am a junkie, a scumbag, a piece of shit, but not fucking that. i am not a sick fucking individual, besides my debilitating depression and whatever other undiagnosed mental disorders i have. i just do not know what to do. i really do not. every ti ame i make a counselor appointment to get help, i miss it. i do not have the energy to get up and go. i am so fucking tired of the way i am living, tired of being a junkie (but i am not and this contradiction is eating me alive) and i just wish my mom actually gave a fuck to come see me once a week. i miss my mother, living with her, i miss my son, my family. but i have no fucking want to change anything. tired of the thoughughts of suicide. tired of thinking i should just kill myself. also grew up withoughut a father. lost all my friends. nobody talks to me, or checks up on me. my girlfriend is a fucking godsend but i am not deserving of her, she could do so much fucking better. and i am also self conscious, could definitely have a bigger dick. never really had trouble with women thoughugh. but i think everyone is a lying fuck and never tells the fucking truth. so, i do not truly know if i please my girlfriend, because i doubt everything and question everything. i apologize for the rant really meant for this to be shorter.

tl;dr how can i gain hope, or traction, or some sort of motivation? also going to be dope sick tomorrow, and the next 4ish days, and hopefully kick my addiction, if my girlfriend does not cave in and buy me a 20. and i have an orientation friday for a potential career opportunity in a mill starting at 16/hr i hope i go to and do not fuck up because my bitch ass is depressed and acting like a fucking pussy. 

(she is part of my problem because she enables me. she does not say no to giving me rides or not give me money when i act like i am sick. and i really do not manipulate her.. honest to god i do not. she is a fucking blessing in disguise and if i lose her, i am losing probably the best woman i will ever meet. she is good looking too, but the love she gives me and putting up with my addiction is amazing. she could probably love me differently, and better but the fact she is putting up with this alone just amazes me.)

my bad.. if anyone even makes it this far.
still miss my whore of a baby mom too..
fuck
this homeless shit sucks btw.
have not sucked dick for dope either.

i recently moved back home after a year and a half of college, due to a mixture of things. in college i was well liked by everyone, i was still bitter and cynical and people hated that aspect of me but people were always nice enough to me. i was friends with everybody that is always kinda been my thing; i float. and that floating may be due to my personality disorder or may be due to my overall big hearted misanthrope personality.

but the thing is nobody's missed me. it is been about a month and half since i have left and nobody's asked where i am or made an effort to contact me. and it is funny to me, i have this phone full of contacts but no one contacts me.

and like even in college, people would not really invite me places. it would just happen i would just end up there, at whatever place or thing was going on and i would go with it. but the thing is i would go out with people and watch people on there phones texting their friends or replying to tweets from their friends etc. and i just wonder why not me? i do not get tagged in the party photos the night after, but i watch all my friends get tagged in them. and i just sit and wonder why?

and i just feel like i am missing out 100% but i guess that is what it is like to be 40% involved with people, because you too scared to get hurt or get close to anyone, and it is tiering.

and it is tricky because i have always been a selfish person, while still very empathetic to others. but i have also tried to kill myself 3 ti ames before. so it shows you how bad i want it but at the same ti ame nobody wants me. i am not loved or cared for i just exist and the only people who care about me have to by proxy, and i am not even sure if i really care about them or if it is just because of a social obigation",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

so naturally i suspected the antiinflammatory i took. going through a particularly bad night it always felt like there was a tangible pain in my head, not pounding but just *there*, nearly weightless but heavy enough to be known, like sadness had a weight. maybe thats inflammation?

1435,"bought and listened to the audiobook. it is worth mentioning that the audiobook version contains podcast discussions. so, there might be some differences.

i should preface this by saying that i normally do not read anything motivational or guru books, but i wanted to give it a try because i am trying to lose some weight, and i thoughught it would not hurt to listen.

the beginning, as with most motivational books, is a bit boring, but i am very glad it did not take long for the book to actually start. honestly, i do not need all the promises for a great and inspirational tale. let me decide that for myself, goggins.

the story/memoir actually begins with goggins' childhood. lots of abuse, discri amination and some learight nowing disabilities due to lingering trauma. gotta say, this part was hard to stomach. i cannot stand depictions of child abuse.

fortunately, goggins, his mother, and a reluctant brother are able to get away from that. and while it does not solve all the problems, i am glad it stops the main threat of physical abuse.

the next few years in goggins' life are full of challenges. at school, at home, on the streets, and they carry on till he decides to join the navy seals.

goggins, however, spends little to no ti ame talking about the relationships with his, then, wife or child. gotta say, i did not like how they are so casually brought up only to be i ammediately cast aside like they are inconsequential. why even bring them up then? he is also very nonchalant about his many divorces; to the point that he spends a single sentence to cover the topic. like i said, if you are ashamed or si amply consider all of that to be irrelevant, why even include it?

i will say, thoughugh, his jouright nowey to losing 100 pounds in 3 months and studying for the entrance exam to the navy was, as expected, very inspirational.

wanna turight now your life around? you can do it very quickly. just gotta develop an obssession with exercise and train for 3 months like there is no tomorrow (i am not being sarcastic, cynical, or skeptical). it really is that si ample (according to goggins).

and while i did not go as crazy as hi am with the gym, i gotta say it did help me commit to not skipping training sessions. good job book!

that said, goggins' experiences in the military are full of pain that seemed unusually abnormal. it would later become clear that he had both a hole in his heart, for which he underwent 2 surgeries much later in the book, and poor stretching practices; that is, none at all. and not just that, a chronic history of underpreparedness.

tbf, it is both commendable as it is laughable that he went through life withoughut stretching. i mean, why? how is that possible? i do wonder if this is a common thing for some people. all trainers i have met, even teachers at school, give students/clients a stretching routine. so, how did this happen?

despite that, and i was not trying to understate any of his accomplishments, goggins really stood out wherever he went due to his devotion to training. i mean, the guy used to run on fractured legs. who does that? certainly not me. not worth it.

however, he also mentioned the mistakes he made by isolating hi amself. because he did not strengthen the relationships with his teammates, he lost many opportunities he really wanted. a valuable lesson learight nowed: there is no 'i' in ""team.""

all in all, i think a marathoughner he met during a (califoright nowia?) race summed it all up really well. we are all idiots trying our best. if i had to name his book, that would be the perfect title. and goggins really had to go the extra mile because of it.

do i recommend this book? yes, that is, if you are looking for extra motivation. and i am saying this si amply because it helped me get motivated when i needed it. however, it is no masterpiece.

will i be reading more of goggins? no. i do not think there is any point to it. however, for me at least, it was worth a single read to learight now why one should not approach challenges unprepared.",noise,noise data,0.95

1437,"my 2025 jouright nowey through vonnegut so far in order: *slaughterhouse-five*, *the sirens of titan*, *cat's cradle*, *player piano*, *mother night*

episode 5 of my rampage through vonnegut's bibliography is undoubtedly the one that has made me the most angry so far. make no mistake, i think this book is brilliant, and its ability to elicit such a visceral response from me is a massive credit to vonnegut's comprehension of the human psyche on an individual and societal level.

this book is about howard w. campbell jr, an american-boright now germany-raised man who became a nazi propagandist, who was then recruited by the us army during wwii to secretively deliver messages in code during his broadcasts which served to aid the allied forces throughout the war. this code was inconspicuous enough that absolutely nobody who did not know exactly how to listen for it could have possibly known it was present at all, and the naked ear would only ever hear blatantly unapologetic nazi propaganda.

vonnegut makes it abundantly clear that campbell knew full well the damage of his actions as a propagandist, regardless of the fact that he knew he was also aiding the us against the nazi regi ame he hi amself worked and spread messages for.

this book has made me (what i believe to be) rationally angry towards the entire ""news"" landscape of today, which serves not to inform us as a society but instead to polarize us and divide us. make no mistake, i have already been angry about that for years, but the microscope this novel put over this specific subject matter has just boiled my blood all over again.

i am forcing myself to read at least one book from a different authoughr between each vonnegut read just to ensure i have had enough ti ame for each of his works to sink in, and this is the first ti ame i have felt that i needed the break rather than i ammediately wanting to open up the next one. and that is in every sense a compli ament in this case, because this degree of emotional response is one of the things i absolutely adore about reading. for now, i will be diving into *jane eyre*.

1443,"i am just tiredthis feeling started last summer and has come in bouts. i guess that i thoughught that everything would be awesome after i graduated high school, boy way i wrong. all that i have ever wanted to do was be a missionary. serving others is really the only way that i experience real joy. unfortunately, being a missionary requires a lot more than bible knowledge and a willingness to go. now a days you can only really get a long term visa somewhere if you have a degree and a valuable trade. 

i am just about to finish my first year of college and i hate it. college has been torture. i love to attend classes and learight now new things, but i cant stand the pressure that i place on myself. i want straight as, but even when i get them i stress about being able to duplicate them. i want to be a doctor but i am barely making it through my first year. i am nursing/pre med and school will do everything but let up in the coming years. 

as i said before, last summer was the start of it all. i was participating in a two month long mission trip and the first two weeks were spent in the swamps of florida training. i got there and i ammediatly began to feel down and wanted to go home. the camp was a living hell. the days and nights were hot and sticky and i have never seen more mosquitoes in my life. we woke up at 5:30 am every day and went nonstop until 9:30pm. we bathed ot of buckets and slept in tents and i wanted to die. it took awhile before i realized that i was going through spiritual warfare. once i realized it i knew how to fight it and my bad feeling went away. the rest of my summer was awesome and one that i will never forget;however, the feeling came back at the start of fall semester, only this ti ame it was focused on school and accli amating to college life and addressing the problem has not proven successful.

my first semester was tough. before i had even started classes i got a job in a research lab. i quickly grew to love work and all of the people that i worked with. i spent as much ti ame at work as i could because it distracted me from my feelings about school. unfortunately, a little after half way through the semester one of my coworkers committed suicide. she was an upperclassman with a bright future ahead of her. 

it was shortly after the start of the semester when i first heard of her depression. i was observing a surgery when my coworkers began to talk about a suicide comment that she had made, and at that very moment i knew that i needed to share the gospel with her. i thoughught about how i would do it every day, but in the end i put it off to long for fear of awkwardness. she ended up taking her own life and i began to feel a deep sense of regret. i knew what i needed to do but stopped myself because i was to selfish. following her death i let my guard down and became even more down about school. it was not until i was accepted to go on a two week mission trip during winter break that i began t cheer up.

i was so excited for the trip and the what was to come that my episodes of getting caught up in my head begun to lessen. whenever i was feeling down i would distract myself with the future. now, that no longer works.

fast forward a few months and i am in the same hole that i was in before, but this ti ame i do not have a shovel. the christmas trip was amazing and i completely forgot about my worries as i devoted all of my ti ame to ministry. this semester has turight nowed out no better than last. i signed up for a semester long trip and should be out for fall of 2017, but this trip comes with it own worries. i will be away from school and i cant stop thinking about what will happen when i get back. i do not want to get behind on school, yet i also do not want to be in school. finals just so happen to be coming up and i have that stress on top of everything else. i am just tired.

thoughughts of ending it have raced through my head, buy i know that i could not do it. i just want to stop existing, but i still want to help people and i do not want to hurt people. i know that my family would not be able to handle it and i know that backing out is not going to do anything to further god's kingdom. i surrendered my life to christ and it is no longer mine to take, i just do not know what to do about this constant state of wanting to give up.

i know that i must live, yet i have no will to do so. someone please help me. i do not want to i ampose my burden on anyone else, but i need some advise. how have you guys dealt when giving up is not an option?

anyways, i am a high school student who is relatively smart, but have a very low amount of motivation. this is a shitty combination, because people have high expectations for me that i am not able to live up to. my mom wants me to be successful, and has very high expectations for me, and to meet these standards i have been lying to her for the past few years of my life. most of these lies are about my grades. at first i was fine with this, but lately i have been doing really poorly in school, and need someone to talk to. i would talk to my mom, but feel like death would be an easier solution than confessing to all of these lies.

to be honest, i have been considering suicide since i was in 6th grade. the only thing stopping me is my mom. she actually admitted to me a while ago that she would kill herself if i did. she is dependent on me (which is why she pushes me when it comes to my success), and i feel like it is unfair that she had me, and yet she is my responsibility.

1485,"most people save whatever's left after spending, but flipping that mindset can actually be a game changer. if you start paying yourself first—like automatically sending 15-20% of your paycheck to savings or investments before you touch bills or spending money—you you will build wealth way more consistently, avoid lifestyle creep, and save yourself the headache of constantly trying to budget.

think of saving like a monthly bill you owe your future self. set up automatic transfers to stuff like a 401(k), roth ira, emergency fund, or even a basic brokerage account. and if 15% sounds like too much, no stress—start with 5% and slowly bump it up after raises or every year.

this works because you basically train yourself to live off what is left. you will not even miss the money once it is gone. plus, compounding is wild—$500/month growing at 7% turight nows into over half a million in 30 years. and having 3-6 months of expenses saved gives you a legit safety net when life gets messy.

also, it helps to keep your savings in separate accounts depending on the goal. high-yield savings accounts are great for emergencies, and index funds work well for retirement. that way, when stuff goes sideways or the market dips, your progress does not fall apart.

your future self will be so glad you started early.

1488,"okay, so, i (f17) kissed my best friend (f18) the other night. i will call her beth for this story. we had both spent a night at a party but neither of us had been drinking. i was on driving duty for some of my other friends and she kept me company while everyone else was drunk. (for reference she does not really like parties anyways)

so the night went on, me and her were just hanging out and talking, everything was normal. and eventually it was getting late and everyone needed a ride home. in our usual fashion when i am designated driver we stopped at mcdonald's and everyone got food. beth forgot her card and so i offered to pay, it was not strange for us to cover each other when it came to small things like food. but then one of our more brash friends who likes to say the first thing that comes to his head made a joke about how i should give hi am tips on how to treat a girl right. beth and i laughed it off but that joke clearly added tension to the air. i kind of felt off for the rest of the ti ame we were there. 

after everyone finished eating, i started dropping them all off at their houses. even thoughugh beth lived close to where we were, i waited to drop her off, si amply because she kept me sane with all thoughse annoying drunk people around. i did not tell her that was what i was doing, but we just shared a look and she knew. when everyone else was home and i was on the way to beth's house i made an off-handed comment about not wanting to go home (due to some parental things that beth knows all about). she was kind enough to offer for me to stay at her place, including that i could borrow her pjs and a change of clothes in the moright nowing.

we were at beth's place and i was using the spare toothbrush i keep at her house when she started talking about the comment our friend made earlier in mcdonald's. she said that i did treat her better than any other guys she would known. she then make a joke that i would make really good boyfriend material. she kept looking at me and pausing and i was not quite sure if it was a hint or not. but after i rinsed my toothbrush i leaned over and kissed her. i would never kissed anyone before and neither had she, but it felt right, like it was not awkward.

then everything went downhill. i started panicking about the i amplications of what that kiss would mean for our friendship and our friend group as a whole. i pulled away and stared at her with the most kind of 'oh shit' look ever. and she had a matching expression on her face. she was maybe about to say something but i blurted out, ""yeah i should just go home tonight probably"" instead. she nodded and agreed. i did not give back her pjs, i just left. went home. 

that was a few nights ago. i thoughught maybe she would text me, but it is been radio silence. i was going to text her but i would not know what to say. this is probably the longest we have gone withoughut sending a single text and it feels weird. last night i went and hung out with some friends, she was suppose to be there but canceled last minute saying she felt under the weather. i think she canceled because she knew i was going to be there. i do not what to do but i know i fucked up. either by actually kissing her or deciding to leave afterwards. 

tl;dr: i kissed my best friend after she made a few jokes about me and her, then left right after because i got scared. now she might be avoiding me. 

update: 
i do not really know how to properly update so maybe no one is going to see this and that is fine. 

i texted beth and asked if we could meet up for lunch today, she agreed and we went. she asked me why exactly i kissed her and i did not quite have an answer. we talked for a while (i actually think the waiter was getting sick of how long we were sitting there for). she ended up saying that she had some kind of feelings for me but did not really understand them all at, and i echoed that same remark. we ended up deciding to keep it under wraps for now to prevent any kind of complications with our friend ground, but either way we both know that the other cares deeply and wants to at least stay friends if things get too complicated. so i guess we are just taking things as they are and talking out any kind of issues that develop.

for a long ti ame, i was extremely apathetic. i understood that the world is a terrible place, not helped by the fact that it is mostly filled with terrible people. for this reason, i really did not care about anyone, myself included. never had any friends. nothing is just good. everything that seems good has something wrong with it if you think about it. in any situation, even if it seems ideal, someone is getting screwed or it would not work. that is the worst part. either you hate life, and are at least glad to see it go, or you love it, and you get to watch it crumble as it goes. 

even as young as 8, i was unable to enjoy things that should be positive. the first and only ti ame i wanted to kiss a girl, i i amagined and felt my lips being buright nowed and sliced off. the first and only ti ame i wanted to hug someone, i i amagined and felt my arms breaking at the shoulders.

it felt awful knowing that there is only one life to live, and it is not even remotely worth it, but i was also somewhat ok with that, because who cares? i was going to die anyway, at least nothing was going to be lost.

it seemed the only thing i ever did enjoy was threatening and hurting people. i do not know if i could call it enjoyment, as i would not go looking for students to abuse, but when i got the opportunity, i took it, and these were the only ti ames that felt real. thoughugh i would not call it the same thing as fun, i think feeling something was the best thing i would known.

this is the part i was almost too embarrassed to type. about a year ago, i watched a few episodes of mlp:fi am to see what everyone was talking about. before long, i would seen the entire thing. i could not believe the effect it had on me. for the first ti ame i was feeling real, strong emotions for others, and they did not even exist. i have been unable to think of anything else since then, and it is absolutely killing me. the situation described in the first paragraph has not changed. the world is still a terrible place, but now i have seen one that is not, and it is such a tease. 

at first i thoughught there was some hope of connecting with people, since it had such a huge fandom, and was disappointed to find out that pretty much everyone else's interest is sexual. 

my dream since then has basically been as follows:

step 1: leave home.

step 2: find a group of people that are so innocent, so utterly angelic.

step 3: eli aminate threats.

you see the problem here, besides the fact that no such people could possibly exist? even in my best dream, i cannot be a friend. i could not express affection if i tried. even in my best dream, the best i can do is keep hurting people and hope that it benefits someone deserving of a perfect life. and i cannot even have that. there just is not anyone worth protecting.

i was not sure if this belonged on this sub. it seemed more appropriate for r/offmychest, but i think this is what depression is. not having a reason to die, but not having any reason to go on, and enjoying nothing. having a near-constant pain behind the eyes that feels like crying, but with no tears ever produced, and staying in bed for hours after waking up with no energy to even try to get up.

i have been out of high school for over a year now. i would move on, but i see no reason to. it would be an i ammense effort. in my situation, getting into a place where i can even think about leaving requires murder. i would do it in a heartbeat if i thoughught it would amount to anything, but i see no light at the end of this tunnel.

tl;dr - why live in a world that is so terrible? why move out, get a job, and live a life i do not want? that i could not possibly enjoy? i have known since i was young that i would most likely want to end it as early as possible, but after attempting it once, i just do not know if i can do it again.

tl;dr with style - ""i know now why you cry, but it is something i can never do.""",depression,suicide,0.95

i especially like to work with clay minerals. these miraculous particles have unique traits that make them exceptionally good materials for environmental applications, and they can be found right in our backyard! (how i fell in love with clays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6de2kaw9yi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6de2kaw9yi) ). over the past nine years our lab has had some exciting breakthroughs using such clay-based materials (https://nocamels.com/2022/01/technion-pollutants-drinking-water/, https://www.ynet.co.il/environment-science/article/5568225). we hope to continue advancing these technologies, making the planet a safer home for all of us.

i am not sure this is the right place to post this, since it does not directly relate to depression, but you all have helped me quite a bit in the past, and i do get very depressed someti ames.

i graduated from high school last year and was accepted into college for spring (january) admission versus the normal fall semester. in the ti ame i had free, i took classes at a nearby community college and stayed with my aunt. however, the change of settings really hit me hard. 

at my high school, i did so much and had such a wonderful friend group. i was my horseback riding team's captain, i was the lead role in several stage performances, i traveled all across the world with my choir, i dj'ed all of our school's dances, and i just overall felt so proud of myself. however, right after i graduated, i lost most of what made me feel so proud in high school. i have just concluded my semester at community college and it was pretty rough. i got so lonely and had nothing to feel proud of. i ended up seeing a therapist because i went through some horrible, horrible slumps of depression.

since then, i have been with my family for winter break and am going to my choice college soon. however, i still feel like i have nothing to be proud of anymore. what are some things i can do to re-establish my self worth? i recently built a computer and i felt really, really good about myself, but i cannot just build a computer every ti ame i get sad. what are some things i can do to make me feel of worth and proud of who i am?",depression,depression,0.90

my gf, who was still in character, insisted that i answer her question. i said my poop was as dark as my soul. my gf put on her latex gloves and instructed me to switch to the face down ass up position. as soon as i did that, my gf pulled down my pants and instructed me to relax. when i asked what was happening, she said she had to put her finger inside my butt. i was about to leap off the bed, but my gf literally kissed my ass and insisted that i allow her to do her job. i never had anything penetrate my ass before until that moment. my gf was gentle, but her lubricated finger felt like a torpedo entering my virgin butthoughle. i repeatedly shouted at my gf that she was making me shit while she repeatedly used medical jargon to explain to me that anal penetration usually felt like shitting. 

i said i wanted her to stop talking to me like she was really a doctor, and please tell me, partner to partner, if i actually was pooping or not because i was fully convinced that i definitely was fucking pooping. my gf eventually pulled out her finger and removed her gloves. i switched from face down ass up to face up feet on the floor. there was no poop when i looked. my gf, who was somehow still in character, diagnosed me with a rare stomach condition and said i had less than 3 days to live, so i should probably have sex with her before it was too late to have sex with anyone. if i knew i was going to get finger fucked in the butt because of fake stomach cramps, i would have gone with a headache. at least i now know my gf suffers from an acute case of crazy.

tl:dr my gf and i decided to roleplay in the bedroom. i was the patient, she was the doctor. it was up to me pick my condition. i went with stomach cramps. little did i know that stomach cramps would prompt my fake doctor gf to do a thoughrough rectal exam.

anyway, being bilingual and flipping between my native language and german all the ti ame, i wrote something along the lines of “ich bin leider schwer erkrankt”, thinking that just meant “i am pretty sick” or “feeling rough.” i did not realize until two weeks later that “schwer erkrankt” in german does not just mean “sick,” it actually i amplies something way more serious, like gravely or seriously ill. think hospital-level.
now i am spiraling a little wondering if the prof thinks i lied. i did not hear back from hi am at all. no reply, no conceright now, no “get well soon” — just silence. and now i am sitting here wondering if i accidentally told this man i was on death's door… and then just ghosted.

hello reddit world! i am a 22yr old female shut in current suffering from a bout of insomnia. thoughught i should finally stop lurking and actually post something seeing as i will be staring at the ceiling the entire night. i have tried to vent out on other sites but have never really gotten any replies besides people handing out yoga mats or other ways to cure/cope with what i am dealing with. all i would really like to know is that i am not alone in this situation.

whelp here it goes. i am an anxiety ridden, depressed, agoraphobic shut in and have been this way for 3-4yrs now ever since i have graduated highschool. havent gone to college or ever held a job. product of a ""helicopter"" mother who controlled a large portion of my life. never got to visit friends, parties and whatnot. nor have i ever been alone outside on my own. at this point i am not sure how to. non-existent dating life should be obvious.

safe to say i am completely dependent on my family. they like to chide and say ""what a good life i have"" seeing as i am at home either prone in bed or playing pc games. took a trip to the emergency room for them to finally see something is wrong. except they have no concept of what anxiety/depression is, what the doctors tell them goes in one ear and right out the other. it is absolutely frustrating.

4yrs is 3 too many. i feel like life is speeding by and i am stuck in the mud surrounded by family too busy with their own lives to actually help me. i have suicidal thoughughts but have yet to act on them. my greatest fear is that eventually i will if nothing changes. 

what friends i do have know my situation, but do not understand the severity of it. also they all have functioning lives (not to undercut their feelings or anything. it is just hard to be involved when they are all talking about school, work, etc.) it would be nice to find someone here who does relate to me. chats are welcome even, althoughugh i do waright now everyone that i am very shy. might freak out and run. hopefully i can change that. 

trying to condence everything is harder than i thoughught. if anyone cares i will elaborate more on things.

tend to fill my ti ame listening to music. currently heaven shall buright now and thy art is murder (mmm so rage-y), i will listen to tool and day and always. open to many genres.

1552,"i am currently reading a collection of harlan ellison's short stories that include: i have no mouth and i must scream, big sam was my friend, eyes of dust, world of the myth, lonelyache, delusions for a dragon slayer, and pretty maggie moneyeyes. i have finished all but pretty maggie, which i am almost done with but i need someone to talk to about them. each of the narrators of the stories are awful in ways that make it clear that the authoughr is aware that they are terrible, but uncertain if there is much distinction between the povs of the characters vs that of the authoughr. for the eponymous story, i feel like so much of moderight now sci fi owe the apparently quite litigious ellison several royalty checks (in particular the matrix and black mirror). it honestly kind of peaked at the title but that is more because the title was so evocative that it would have been nearly i ampossible to live up to it. that being said, the story itself certainly came close.

big sam was my friend honestly was my favorite. of course there is the still relevant societal critique on both traditional fundamentalists and inactive bystanders but honestly just the premise of a man who is traveling through space trying to find heaven to get to a lost loved one is a concept i am kind of obsessed with. 

for both eyes of dust and world of the myth i kind of wish he had taken his ti ame a bit more. a story where an i amage obsessed society rots with its own evil after destroying someone they felt was their lesser is kind of amazing but the actual prose were a bit obvious and the story was really rushed. i needed more ti ame to connect to the characters. meanwhile a story that ends with the i amplication that an unlikeable dork, a deplorable rapist, and a woman who has the nerve to lead a man on would all i ammediately kill themselves in despair if they had to face who they really were really needs more ti ame to get me on board with the characters being complex rather than taking for granted the super dated idea that women are just asking for it.

lonelyache and delusions for a dragon slayer are the ones that have me questioning where the character ends and the authoughr begins. lonelyache was so weird and creepy and while i was not as taken by the ""trippy visuals"" so many talk up for delusions (there have been 60 years of trippy visuals depicted since its initial release) its subversion of a swashbuckling fantasy is doing leaps and bounds better than a lot of attempts at genre subversions released today. however i have to rate this story a 0/10 and hold ellison's estate personally liable for the harm inflicted on me with the words ""labial moisture.""

so, thoughughts? feelings? vibes? these stories are weird and trippy and depressing and each one that i finish leaves me with a feeling of ""...what?""

after my class today, i walked over to the dorm hall that they were staying in and waited about 10 minutes. they came down to the lobby where i was and brought me back up to their dorm on the third floor. 

after we got settled, they told me they were going to hotbox in the bathroom and that i was coming with them. i am not a smoker by any stretch of the i amagination, but i did not mind sitting there watching them rotate and making small talk. 

this is where i fuck up. at some point, the girl in question mentions something about the roommate having a “dick appointment”. i thoughught out loud that i was not there for that, trying to make myself clear. i said something along the lines of, “i have got a condom in my backpack but i promise i am not here for anything like that”. why the hell i said it, i have no idea, so i will just blame my asperger's. 

then i dig my grave. they mention something about the lgbtq+ group on campus giving out condoms and they bring up the fact that condoms expire. so i went to grab the one i had to see if it was expired. i told them again i had no intention of being there for a hookup, and i made a remark about the weird way the waright nowing was sideways compared to the branding. 

after they finished hotboxing, i sat next to her on her bed in the dorm room watching sml. at some point, i say, “can i ask you something stupid? can i get a hug? i just really need one, it is been a rough day.”

she said that she did not do physical contact and i respected her answer and her wishes. at about 1:30, they kick me out of the dorm room because the roommate's parents were coming to pick up something. i said my goodbyes and left. i texted the initial girl who set us up and they had been talking about the condom incident. i apologized and said i was just trying to make small talk and that i did not mean anything by it. i saw as she left me on delivered then blocked me, and i went ahead and did the same with her sister. 

i feel so horrible about what i said, and i know that they think i am some creep or pervert despite me not only not being one, but not coming off as one. i was just trying to make conversation in an area where i felt out of place.

both two psychologists i have seen and my boyfriend think that my life is not bad at all, and i have no reason to be depressed. despite that i told them about my suicidal intentions, one of my psychologist asked me if i “just want to live my life to the fullest” because she did not think i have serious problems. the other psychologist said that he thoughught i had been functioning well. i have to mention that both of the two psychologist i have seen are reliable and experienced. they have been working in the clinic in my college for years. so their words should have some truth within. however i have no idea why i am feeling so bad from ti ame to ti ame.


my boyfriend, being more blunt than the psychologists, said he thoughught i was spoiled. in the end i do not trust anyone and i have to deal with the whole thing by myself. i cannot talk to my parents either. they have put a lot of expectation on me, spending a lot of money on my education and i cannot let them down. maybe my issue is not the typical depression which is much more acute and persistent. i have been feeling bad about myself and my life since 13 years old until now (21 years old), and yet nobody knows i am depressed unless i tell them.

1585,"so this used to be a rockwall on both sides but the roof started leaking and it caused some of the rock wall to fall. so i decided to tear down the rock wall and i grinded all the mortar down to the cinderblocks again. i am not a professional so i was hoping to get some advice on what needs to be done to get this fireplace safely restored.

my main questions are the following.

1. what should i use to seal the gaps between the fireplace surround and the wall

2. is it safe to use drywall around the fireplace (on the concrete walls) as the actual fireplace will fake rocks tiled on or something si amilar.

3. anything i should know or use when tiling the fireplace surround for example what material to use etc.



i have done drywalling before and as for the electrical, i am planning on putting some new boxes and a cover on the cable to protect it from nails. just my main conceright now is the fireplace and how to properly seal it to prevent any possible damage happening behind the walls.

1588,"i cannot stop thinking of ending it all...through my life i have had issues with anxiety and depression do to my up bringing. i am  now 30 years old, turight nowing 31 on feb. i dropped out of community college and moved to ny when i was 25 working as a concierge. i was hoping by the ti ame i got to 30, i would have some sort of idea of what i want to do with my life, and that i would change enough to get my ass up and make something out of myself. now, do to the pandemic, i lost my job, and i had to move back into my parents place.  i have been living there since the pandemic had started. 

 as i stayed there my mental heath worsened. i do not believe that i am meant for this world, everyone around, including my siblings, are still able to work and make a living. my younger sister is currently making moves to close on a new house, my older brother is an attoright nowey and helping his wife get her baking business off the ground. my older sister is not doing as well as them, but she still manages to find work and is living with her boyfriend. i feel like i am a tremendous burden on my family and friends.  they all still show love and support, except my father. my father as always been an angry man and his disappointment in me only grows, and i sense my brother is getting tired of me as well. 

my best friend had a pretty good paying job but he also lost it do to the pandemic. with the money he saved up, he decided to travel west to find hi am self. he knew what staying at my parents house was doing to my mental state and convinced me to fly out and join hi am mid november. he thinks it would help me break out of this mental state and perhaps find myself. i am here now trying to create a routine that will change my state of mind. we meditate, make goals to reach, exercise, and take breaks by camping out in nature. some days i feel okay, but every moright nowing is the same. i wake up i ammediately filled with anxiety and depression. i meditate to try and see that these are just negative thoughughts and they do not make who i am. it is very very difficult. i can also see that my friend is getting tired of my behavior.

  i am left with the feeling that i am not like everyone around me. i would not be able to survive on my own. every job i got was from help of my parents, and i was fired from most of them. the only reason i end up traveling is due to my best friend convincing me to go and he would cover most expenses. i always need saving, i always need someone to do something for me. i never know what is the right thing to do. i enjoy art (story boarding/ character design) and comedy, two professions that require a lot of effort and ti ame and i am already 31, i feel hopeless to achieve such goals.  i am the dead beat brother in every tv show or movie. i am pathetic!!!  

everyday i have thoughughts to end it all. i spend hours thinking on how i would do it, what is the most painless way to go. the only thing that is honestly keeping me from doing it is that it would literally destroy my family. i have started writing notes, but i know nothing i can say would help my family if i am gone. i almost wish i had shitty family so this would be easier but i know to have such a support system is a blessing and i remined myself that i am lucky to have them. i feel stuck in misery. i realize that they are people out there that are much worse off, but that does not make me feel any better. almost every experience i have, i feel numb and my best friend someti ames is surprised that i have no reaction to some of the things we see and i agree with hi am. i should have more appreciation for life, but i just do not.",SuicideWatch,suicide,0.95

1592,"someone, omehow, very soon must end this.hello to everyone!

the reason i open this topic, is because i do not have anyone to talk about my problem. i do not think that this topic will change my life, but i feel the need to share my problem with someone, even if i do not know hi am/her.

my story begins five years ago, when i was a student. then, i had a few friends and some really good friends. thoughse guys were my buddies and we used to hang out since elementary school. it was that age, when my friend started to be interested for new things that i was not. my friends used to do things that i did not like. so i was starting to spend less and lesser ti ame with them and i was seeking some new ones. i was able to find some new friends but i could not get in their companionship, so i was left withoughut a buddy. the next year, all the students of my age (18) were giving exams to enter the university. that year, i was just studying, nothing more, i did not have any life. i managed to enter the university, so i was really excited for my new life. therefore, once more i could not find any ""best"" friend. the years were passing until the previous summer, when i met some people and i was trying to get into their companionionship. i have not managed to do that until now. on december i met a girl that i thoughught she might be the one. we were studying together and hang out with common friends. i felt that she was also interested for me, so i spoke to her about my feelings. unfortunately, she was not into this. moreover, i was not able to get her out of my mind, i was always thinking about her. we stopped talking and hang out. so i just left only with her in my mind. moreover the university started to be more and more difficult and i was feeling a lot of pressure and anxiety. 

many will say to talk to my family but i hate them. they are only interested about their jobs. during my university period i was trying to leave my house and go live by myself. i was trying to find a job, but even that did not work.

thoughse five years, i always think that i want to end everything. i can not find any reason to live for. for my bad luck i am not able to commit a suicide, despite of the thoughughts that i have every day. every night i try to sleep and i hope my heart will stop, so i will not wake up the next moright nowing. this girl changed my thinking, there were days that suicide was not on my thoughughts, she replaced it. but, as i said she does not want me. 

i hate my life, i hate my society, i hate my family, i do not know if i need help, i do not know if i have a problem, i just know that i cannot continue to live like this. every weekend i am alone, every holiday i am alone. someti ames i cannot stand it and i cry like a baby. 

i know there are people who are like me. also i know that there are people who are in worse situation. i have read some of the topics here and i can see that i am not alone but how can you get over it? all my tries failed. i have not managed to get some buddies, nothing to say abut a girl.

1594,"i love libby -- i shall start by saying that. this is by no means meant to downplay how awesome it is. 

but managing the queue has felt a bit like a chore, and i wanted to know if you all more experienced libby uses have developed a strategy.

i mostly use libby for audiobooks, and i like long books. however, my library only allows 7 days for poplar books. when you have a 28 hour audiobook-- well.... finishing it would become a chore, because at mini amum, you had have to listen to 4 hours a day. 

here's my problem: i know the common strategies -- listen while you do dishes, listen on commutes, etc. etc. i already know that. but planning to listen that much every single day for four hours mini amum makes reading feel like a job. i do not want my hobby to feel like a job. i want to listen when i can fully enjoy it. making sure i map out reading ti ames feels like opti amizing the fun out of reading.

that inevitably means the rental will lapse, and with popular books, it may be another two months before i can get it again. 

if there is anyone out there with a si amilar struggle, what strategies do you take? do you take notes so it is easier to pick back up in a few months? do you just carry on listening and hope you remember relevant details?
